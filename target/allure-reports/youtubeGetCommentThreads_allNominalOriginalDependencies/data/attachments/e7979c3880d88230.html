                            &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;@Imperator Caesar No, you didn&amp;#39;t literally say &amp;quot;they are all culturally the same&amp;quot;, you said &amp;quot;they are all the same cultural group&amp;quot;. You&amp;#39;re being imprecise and then blame me for misunderstanding. It&amp;#39;s not the first time this happens. You&amp;#39;re wrong in both cases anyway. Being in the same cultural group doesn&amp;#39;t mean they are culturally the same. And as you know being culturally the same doesn&amp;#39;t mean they are all identical. There are important declinations of culture in all cultures past a certain size. No, it&amp;#39;s not a detail. They only teach you sciences in your school?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet again you show preconceptions about my views. You first said I was saying there is no idiots (I never said that) and now you say I said everyone can contribute as much as Einstein, which I never said either.&lt;br /&gt;You give a definition of science that is well accepted (problem solving capacity) and that you implicitely used (by talking about IQ tests) and then say actually it&amp;#39;s not intelligence? If you&amp;#39;re describing something you&amp;#39;ve read, you&amp;#39;re describing it badly, or lazily maybe.&lt;br /&gt;Problem solving, like creativity, like memory, like abstraction power, are all aspects of intelligence. When there is two people being very good at only one of those things you can consider them intelligent without being able to tell who is superior.

                            &quot;textOriginal&quot;: &quot;@Imperator Caesar No, you didn&#39;t literally say \&quot;they are all culturally the same\&quot;, you said \&quot;they are all the same cultural group\&quot;. You&#39;re being imprecise and then blame me for misunderstanding. It&#39;s not the first time this happens. You&#39;re wrong in both cases anyway. Being in the same cultural group doesn&#39;t mean they are culturally the same. And as you know being culturally the same doesn&#39;t mean they are all identical. There are important declinations of culture in all cultures past a certain size. No, it&#39;s not a detail. They only teach you sciences in your school?\n\nYet again you show preconceptions about my views. You first said I was saying there is no idiots (I never said that) and now you say I said everyone can contribute as much as Einstein, which I never said either.\nYou give a definition of science that is well accepted (problem solving capacity) and that you implicitely used (by talking about IQ tests) and then say actually it&#39;s not intelligence? If you&#39;re describing something you&#39;ve read, you&#39;re describing it badly, or lazily maybe.\nProblem solving, like creativity, like memory, like abstraction power, are all aspects of intelligence.

I hate zionists, so I don&amp;#39;t feel empathy for them. Second, I literally said &amp;quot;they are all culturally the same&amp;quot;, which means they are the same in the context of culture. Because that&amp;#39;s what your wording in the previous comment alluded to, culture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, no it isn&amp;#39;t a brutish way to look at intelligence. It&amp;#39;s a scientific way to look at intelligence, and you are the one going against the scientific consensus with your bullshit liberal claims that anyone can contribute to the world as much as Einstein and all other great scientists. Being more intelligent doesn&amp;#39;t mean you are more capable of making logical connections and solve problems naturally. It  means you have a capacity to be better. For example, an intelligent person can use his knowledge in an efficient way, while an idiot could have the greatest memory yet he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to use his prior knowledge to think of new things. Essentially, this is a greater capacity for creativity, the use of previously learned knowledge and combining that knowledge from different fields to solve problems. That&amp;#39;s what intelligence is, and some people simply aren&amp;#39;t as good at doing that than others. It&amp;#39;s not a brutish, superficial, or short sighted concept. It&amp;#39;s science.&quot;,

If you make an absolute claim, my experience alone can disprove it.\nThere is no one with low intelligence anyway, with a few exceptions, as I&#39;ve told you already.\nLow confidence, mainly, makes people act like idiots. A desire to fit in, also, like you said.\n\nI&#39;ve rarely been the popular one, and I know how people can be shallow and conformist and hypocritical and lots of others things that can make them seem stupid, but none of that has to do with intelligence per say. In the right cirumstances, everyone can be like that, even you and I.\n\nYou know that zionists are millions? There are every kind of people in there. Every kind of differences. They&#39;re all unique. You just slap a label on them and it makes it all disappear, even though thousands, tens of thousands, maybe more, of them are people \&quot;like you\&quot; that you said you would care about.&quot;,
