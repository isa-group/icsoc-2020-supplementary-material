                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;Saddam knew how these religious morons were. He knew what it took to keep them under control . &lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see how removing Saddam and especially the Baath party was a good idea as a method to fight terrorism. There wasn&amp;#39;t terrorists in Iraq until we went in there. It seems to me that this was counter productive. Destabilizing countries fuels terrorism. I thought the U.S. objective was to hunt down and deal with the oxygen thieves that murdered 3k Innocent people. Bush flew in and declared victory like 16 years &lt;a href=\&quot;http://ago.lol/\&quot;&gt;ago.LOL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could be wrong and I could be missing something.&lt;br /&gt;It was the U.S./ CIA primarily that helped put Saddam in power. It was about fighting communism. The only good think I can think of about going into Iraq was it was great training for the U.S. military. &lt;br /&gt;Its as if Bush and his administration had a personal beef with Saddam. Disbanding the Baath party was a horrible decision. &lt;br /&gt;The U.S. has made some pretty bad decisions on the account of fighting communism. It all comes back to communism when you really educate yourself on it. The soilders that go over there don&amp;#39;t make policy. They follow orders and do a amazing job. They&amp;#39;re the best.

                        &quot;textOriginal&quot;: &quot;Saddam knew how these religious morons were. He knew what it took to keep them under control . \nI don&#39;t see how removing Saddam and especially the Baath party was a good idea as a method to fight terrorism. There wasn&#39;t terrorists in Iraq until we went in there. It seems to me that this was counter productive. Destabilizing countries fuels terrorism. I thought the U.S. objective was to hunt down and deal with the oxygen thieves that murdered 3k Innocent people. Bush flew in and declared victory like 16 years ago.LOL\nI could be wrong and I could be missing something.\nIt was the U.S./ CIA primarily that helped put Saddam in power. It was about fighting communism. The only good think I can think of about going into Iraq was it was great training for the U.S. military. \nIts as if Bush and his administration had a personal beef with Saddam. Disbanding the Baath party was a horrible decision. \nThe U.S. has made some pretty bad decisions on the account of fighting communism. It all comes back to communism when you really educate yourself on it. The soilders that go over there don&#39;t make policy. They follow orders and do a amazing job. They&#39;re the best. The U.S. would be just a memory if it wasn&#39;t for our soilders.\nKinda like Charlie Wilson said,\&quot; We go in and do a amazing job and Then we screw up the end game.\&quot;\n   The number one threat to capitalism is communism. \n  The U.S. will do whatever it takes to maintain the power of this country.

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;They always say &amp;quot;you only live once&amp;quot; but many people die pushing their luck and most in fairly dangerous sport will die between 30 and 45 years of age.  So that&amp;#39;s NOT living your life when you had maybe 50 more years cut off of your life span if you die at 30!  That&amp;#39;s not living, that&amp;#39;s risking.  But clearly many don&amp;#39;t take that seriously.  When surfing, if you go down with the lip of the wave, it IS going to push you way down and many break their necks or have other bad injuries when they are pounded against rock, reef or sand and with tons of water pounding down on you, you ARE going to go down.  Some never even surface and their bodies are found later, from 15 minutes, often washed down the beach to 5 days later or never.  It is risky but many think it&amp;#39;s worth it.  Some quit while they are ahead of those dangerous Xtreme sports and live a long, happy life with many adventures and joy that they wouldn&amp;#39;t have had if they&amp;#39;d died in surf or wingsuiting, BASE jumping, skiing, mountain climbing, whatever.  They just didn&amp;#39;t get the chance because they died &amp;quot;doing what they loved&amp;quot; like everyone says, but IF YOU DIE, you NEVER know the joy you could have the next 50 years that could far surpass those few minutes of adrenaline rush and danger!  I was a thrill-seeker a while back, and I had some close calls and quit while I was ahead.  I&amp;#39;ve never been sorry.&quot;,

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;I wonder if the government will ever tell the truth, that they were directly responsible for 9/11, that it was a perfectly staged demolition. Every single shred of evidence points towards this disaster being an inside job. It is literally and physically impossible for both the towers plus Tower seven to fall just because a jet flew into them, or in towers seven’s case, just because a fire. All three buildings were designed to easily survive. It would have destroyed all materials inside the building but the frame would still be standing. The fact you can see molten steel dripping from the side of the building is a dead giveaway that thermite, very common demolition explosive, used to cut through steel I-beams with great precision, once used to weaken the superstructure, and then in the end, what is the direct cause of the collapse. No building on earth could fall in on itself so perfectly by accident, it is theoretically impossible, and just remember the politics of the time just before 911, when Bush was dying to invade Iraq. He wasn’t able to convince the Senate to do so, so he and the evil powers that be concocted this disaster all so They could not only to clear war on Iraq, and pillage there a vast I’ll reserve is destroying the entire country, not to mention killing thousands of innocent Americans, but also so he could create the department of homeland security, another thing the Senate refused to approve, but after 911, when everybody believed The lies, before the truth was discovered, he was able to do both with the Senate and the American public‘s blessing. It is probably the darkest day not just in American history but in world history, when a countries own government slaughtered thousands of innocent civilians and destroyed the very heart and soul of its biggest city, all purely for materialistic and political greed and dominance. I am not one to give into crackpot conspiracy theories, I’ve done my homework, it’s something I’ve studied in detail and at links for many many years, I could literally write several books just based on the evidence I have obtained, it’s so bloody obvious, that if people were made aware of all evidence, much of which is very difficult to find now as it was quietly buried, along with the thousands of people that died, they would instantly come to the same conclusion I have. I’m not basing this on whimsical perceptions, I am basing it on scientific fact, scientific fact that is absolutely and literally impossible to dispute. Yet here we are, in 2018, and the true culprits have never been held accountable. That is absolutely disgusting, and headed into my loved one that died in one of the towers, and God be with all those that did, I would make it my mission in life to fight until the truth was revealed at all costs, because those that were murdered, deserve at least that much, they deserve for the truth to be told, and for those responsible held accountable for their actions. Nothing will ever bring back all those people, nothing will ever fix the thousands of broken families and broken lives, but, finally put it to rest, knowing the true culprits, would bring tens of thousands of people peace of mind, and perhaps allow them to finally heal and start moving on with their lives. My heart and soul goes out to every single person affected by this tragedy. I’m so thankful that nobody I know was seriously harmed, but I did have friends in tower one that day, funny enough, the meeting that was supposed to attend was cancelled because the boss called in sick, so everybody went back to their head office outside of Manhattan. Anyways, please let me know if you actually agree with me, I promise you I am not making this up, and I promise you that your government is truly that evil, if you don’t believe me look at what’s going on right now, with that sexist/racist/homophobic/bigoted/ignorant piece of shit sitting in the White House as we speak! I’m sorry to say this is America, but you know longer live in a democracy, you live in the illusion of such, but in reality, you live in a carefully concealed dictatorship, where every single one of you are brainwashed and lied to on a daily basis, so much so, that people have finally stopped resisting because it’s just too overwhelming, and it’s hard enough getting through life without having to deal with all this shit. I mean absolutely no offence when I say this, but your once great nation has fallen, the damage irreparable. The best we can hope for is to get that bastard out of the White House, find somebody who’s a true leader, a true patriot and statesman, who will restore what your country truly represents, freedom and love, may God be with you all, with all my love, hopes, and best wishes and intentions, from Toronto.❤️&quot;,

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;Forgiving others starts with you. You cannot forgive others, unless you have first forgiven yourself. Forgiveness is the greatest gift you can give yourself. It&amp;#39;s for you completely and you choose what that looks&lt;br /&gt;like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s giving yourself freedom from what hurts. It’s giving yourself time to feel good again.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First acknowledge the pain. Give vent to indignation. Cut out the self-recrimination. Pull up the roots of negativity with its anger and bitterness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop living in the past. It&amp;#39;s frozen in history. Yet, let your present be informed by that past. Stop buying into the lies. Affirm and value what you know to be good and&lt;br /&gt;true about yourself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgiveness of others doesn&amp;#39;t mean you will necessarily forget what they’ve done to you. Nor does it mean pretending it never happened. It means you no longer hold it&lt;br /&gt;against them personally.  It means you release your right to personally retaliate against them for their offences. Obviously, this type of forgiveness doesn’t require the other person to ask for it. It’s given simply as a matter of &amp;quot; grace.  It means you give permission to move on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just because you forgive others doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have to communicate. &lt;br /&gt;It’s not about giving others back a relationship, just so that they can abuse you and drain you of your life energy, all over again, violating your trust. Trust is earned. People locked in anger and pain can be self-centered, self-pitying. That’s their choice, not yours. You don’t have to be a part of that. Rather, remember the positive in them; hold on tight to even the smallest memory of joy that you once shared.  Forgiveness means you can just walk away with a clear conscience and with a heart filled with peace.&quot;,
