They provide us with food [yes, I know, except for vegans amd for the most part when in vegetarians&amp;#39; cases (vegtarians simply don&amp;#39;t eat meat, while vegans not only don&amp;#39;t eat meat, they also don&amp;#39;t eat anything that isn&amp;#39;t meat, yet still comes from animals, such as milk and cheese) ], companionship, comfort, and more. Why, some animals have even saved peoples&amp;#39; lives before, and not just domestic dogs and houscats saving their owners, oh no, there have been cases of wild amimals that could easily kill a human saving one or more peoples&amp;#39; lives, and in some of those cases, the animal doesn&amp;#39;t even know the person who they saved- they&amp;#39;re complete strangers to each other! Plus, animals are cute amd adorable! 😊&quot;,

Now you’re trying to critique him for something which is completely separate from sexism. Accept that in this case you have been wrong and stop trying to evolve the argument to try and win points over when I plainly shut them down every single time. Brown is perfectly entitled to criticise a woman’s views, yet Johnson decided to belittle a section of society purely based on an immutable part of their anatomy: if you cannot see the difference then I’m afraid you’re one hell of a fool.&quot;,

Three weeks ago, two of the four x-ray bands disappeared .&lt;br /&gt;according to the interpretation, the solar core has 4 generating layers, and&lt;br /&gt;two remain. Water consumption in the ocean conveyor belt has increased , data&lt;br /&gt;on water consumption was previously on the yoshimo website.

Changes in temperature and humidity , as well as a&lt;br /&gt;decrease in the total radiation flow from the sun, create ideal conditions for&lt;br /&gt;mutations of new types of viruses.

Until then, a country should shut down in very drastic ways. Money should not be as important as lives. \rLook at Italy, where in 10 days their confirmed case rate increased five-fold.&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;Those within 1 social link of a confirmed case who deem their own need to travel a higher priority than the safety of their community and beyond should be charged with attempted mass murder and jailed for a minimum of 20 years. That would be very extreme, but would also very quickly nip this in the bud. \r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;All those with the virus should be loaded onto CBRN vehicles and taken to CBRN specialised hospitals. \r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore our entire healthcare system, and those around the world, should all be re-worked to make containment of epidemics much easier. There should be self-reporting laws, especially for those working in close proximity to animals, and testing facilities need significantly more funding, as well as the infectious disease portions of the healthcare system. We need dedicated ICHs (intensive care hospital) located in every city, with &amp;#39;loading bays&amp;#39; where the insides of a CBRN vehicle and the outside world cannot mix. \r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;We need more funding for teams like the United States&amp;#39; FEMA, and a FEMA team in every 250 square kilometres. \r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;We also need a portion of our economy diverted into a disaster fund on the order of £50+bn. If it is not used (due to there not being a disaster, or the disaster being very cheap to mitigate) it is then re-allocated the following year to reduce student debt, dilapidated housing and to subsidise our technologically advanced sectors to improve the likelihood that the forefronts of the cutting edge fields are more likely to come to our country and stay here.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;This is probably still not enough. But it&amp;#39;s definitely a start. I do not have CoViD-19. I am still quarantining myself due to the fact I live with extremely vulnerable people. This is a social responsibility which I do not shirk, for I am not so selfish as to risk the lives of those around me. I have friends I want to go and see, but I don&amp;#39;t in case I come in contact with CoViD-19 and transmit it to somebody who unlike me, will likely die of the disease that will probably affect me personally no worse than a seasonal flu.&quot;,

My grievance was with people complaining about the show changing the atmosphere. Whilst an author can influence the atmostphere of their work, they can never completely control it because a large part of it comes down to individual interpretation. That&amp;#39;s why I think that adaptations should alter the atmostphere slightly, because it not only pays tribute to the original but because it also contributes to different opinions on the work and consequently, the intrest and longevity of a text. I will also be angry if this series ignores important dialogue or themes, the objective should be to maintain the integrity and structure of the original whilst contributing through commentary, not radical change.&quot;,

                            &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;@Kami Sorani I cannot disagree with much of what you say, but maybe try to explain my stance with something comparable.  I may think, that it is acceptable to present a cover of the Beatles &amp;quot;A Day In The Life&amp;quot; for a modern audience, by changing the tempo or instrumentation etc.. but not for a minute would I think it so, to  change the chord structure, melody or radically mess with the lyrics.   My view maybe different from many, but I don&amp;#39;t think adaptation means do whatever want with another persons work, just as long as it bears a thread of the story.  I certainly, would not want anybody doing such with anything I had produced, be it as a writer,  musician, artist or whatever.   Saying this, this mini series might be great, but I do feel that, based on the story by Charles Dickens, is a more fitting description than an that of an adaptation and as such, both its title and characters is taking a liberty.&quot;,

I also wouldn&amp;#39;t say that it isn&amp;#39;t noble to change certain aspects of the text. It doesn&amp;#39;t imply that the original text was bad, it implies that the concept was so good that it can be pulled in other directions and still be effective. You spoke about modernisation, the problem with making the text modern without changing the presence of it is that it can often lose its edge. ACC was so effective at the time because of how popular Christianity was, even in the midst of secularisation. Dickens was able to scare the heavilly Christian and superstitious audience with ease to achieve a desired reaction but it is harder to envoke that a&lt;br /&gt;Reaction now. The concept of a spirit by itself is less terrifying today because of our larger understanding of science and exposure to media that is designed to scare us like horror films. If the writers want to achieve the same reaction as Dickens created in a more modern audience, they have to be more dramatic and dark at times. Following this reasoning, whilst the script may have changed on the surface, it is still arguably the same because it achieves the same desired effect that couldn&amp;#39;t be achieved in the modern era without modern techniques. Personally, I am open to any changes because I see it as a tribute to the story&amp;#39;s longevity and interest. I also believe that change is often necessary to make a story intresting for a different audience.&quot;,

Also, certain aspects of it put me off. Hugh is a man Ross saved from a French prison. He IMMEDIATELY steps off the boat and starts making moves on her, lol. I mean didn&amp;#39;t she think to herself, &amp;quot;hey, why is this guy who my husband saved ready to screw him over so quickly?&amp;quot;. I agree though that Ross and his infidelity with Elizabeth TOTALLY destroyed his character. Ross always had MASSIVE flaws, but he also had great characteristics too [for instance, saving Demelza and seeing something in her when everyone else just saw her as trash]. The long period of love he has with Demelza makes it MORE UNREALISTIC in my eyes that he would still have this childish fascination with Elizabeth after SUCH a long &amp;#39;waiting&amp;#39; period. I mean SO MUCH happens between Season 1 to Season 2.5 that his leftover attraction to Liz feels - well, like BS. Just unrealistic.&quot;,

Also, I get that later events in the books present Ross as the father of her child... but I think a bit of clever scriptwriting could have totally done away with that. After all, S5 has deviated from the novels anyway. They could have done it and kept the characters intact. They had so many trials and tribulations... why use &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; one that really cheapened them. Plus, if you watch Seasons 1 and 2... it makes absolutely no sense for Ross to have THAT level of &amp;#39;feeling&amp;#39; for Elizabeth after such a long period of time apart, and the love of his life in-between and all the adventures. Ridiculous [as shown on the series]. And Demelza&amp;#39;s pick was even weirder. Just unrealistic.&quot;,

It is cognate with the Sanskrit -sthāna and ultimately the root is to be found in the reconstructed protoindoeuropean *stā-, it must have meant “place” since all the words that have derived from it (not only in languages from the indoeuropean family found in India or Iran, but in European ones as well) ultimately mean “place” or refer in some context to “place”. Kazakhstan, for example, exactly means “land of the Kazakhs” and it isn’t very surprising that the word has been loaned into Turkic languages since basically all the important empires in the region had been born in what today is Iran, before the Muslim conquest, and still often afterwards. Plus, nomads who spoke languages from these families inhabited the Eurasian steppe for millennia and we know nomads who spoke Turkic languages definitely came in contact with them. In fact, the history and genetics of these Turkic nomads is veiled in mystery and it’s quite interesting in the sense that the image we have of “asian looking fierce warriors” has slowly but steadily become obsolete the more we’ve been able to learn thanks to the work done on historical records and archaeological discoveries, tho i image there would be more than 1 butthurt Turkish nationalist angry about that. Well, I’ve deviated a bit from the centre of the comment, anyways, though -stan in itself doesn’t carry a negative meaning, since this suffix has been mostly in use in that region and due to the fact that they’re mostly Muslim countries and full of people who genetically would be considered european (although, just giving a example of many that are available, many people in the region carry the R1a “asian” variant (asian in the sense that it’s the common variant of that one in the region) that is definitely related with the R1a variant that is common in Eastern Europe and somewhat in Northern Europe, and more distantly with the R1b haplogroup that’s the most common one in Western Europe and still common in the rest of Europe, most of those people have ancestors who belonged to other groups who aren’t related genetically to Europeans and so, there’s not many people left in the region who we could say are related enough genetically with any european population to say that they can be considered white, thus the insult, signifying a land that will at some point be filled with people who aren’t from there by blood and have no relation with the neighbouring populations related to the ones of that country).&quot;,

And the original wasn’t exquisite CGI either! Both movies are obviously working within limits (financial and technological.) Just give it a chance!

Correct. This is why it&amp;#39;s important for a girl to find a partner before 30 instead of spending her life sleeping around which is quite easy for an average female i might add of between 18-25, then wondering why no man wants to have babies with her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast a man&amp;#39;s attractiveness goes up with age because he has more resources to provide and usually gets larger if he works out.

Their sermons were between 9 - 10 minutes while his sermon was &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhV0PL49d3Y&amp;amp;t=13m39s\&quot;&gt;13:39&lt;/a&gt;.

Apparently there is the assumption that the royal family is somehow special and superior to us mere &amp;quot;commoners.&amp;quot; Their reactions to a speech that was delivered in a manner they were not used to was downright rude. Their rudeness should be disdained, not the pastor&amp;#39;s message of love. This &amp;quot;commoner&amp;quot; knows how to show common courtesy and the &amp;quot;royals&amp;quot; lack of courtesy is the true embarrassment.&quot;,

I don&amp;#39;t see the sun raising in the east during that one point of the year everywhere (for the most part) all at once... you know.. like a globe?

This isn&amp;#39;t rocket science or math.. it&amp;#39;s just pure unquestionable logic. you&amp;#39;d think the sun would be slightly north or south on that day, if the world was flat.. I would hope to see that.. or at least understand why it&amp;#39;s not. but sadly XD &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&amp;#39;s not always what you want. So i don&amp;#39;t believe in globe cause i choose to, I believe in the only thing that hasn&amp;#39;t been ruled out. sun rise in fall Equinox due east pretty much everywhere, due to the earths tilt, and i still see no flat earth math or science, proving what the reason for this is yet. Therefore, they admit that they know they can&amp;#39;t deny the proof of the globe earth, but lie anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed something, people who believe in globe, tend to use evidence and arguments to show their stance. What do flat earthers do? 90% of the time they are using excuses or cheerypicking whatever they can about the little details to get their way. 10% of the time, they make up the stupidest nonsense you&amp;#39;ll ever see. Just sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat earthers are honestly almost always dishonest. do you want your role model to do that? I sure wouldn&amp;#39;t.&quot;,

Density is also a function of composition and temperature. Denser to lighter moves the objective down and lighter to denser moves the objective up. Your eyes are simply receptors of light. When you zoom you just increase in the focal lenght of the lens. Focal length is the distance between the center of the lens and the image sensor. By moving the lens farther from the image sensor inside the camera body, the zoom increases because a smaller portion of the scene strikes the image sensor, resulting in magnification. That reduces the effects of refraction, distortion and perspective.&quot;,
