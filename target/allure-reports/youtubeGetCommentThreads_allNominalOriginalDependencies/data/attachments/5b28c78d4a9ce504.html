                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;Long time Bernie supporter. But I call bullshit on many of his statements. First off, he has been over 300 delegates  behind for weeks now. There has bee zero change in that since the last primary; and none of the Wisconsin votes have even been released yet; so there is no evidence that is going to change one way or another. Second; he says he would do whatever he must do make sure that Donald rump doesn&amp;#39;t win another term; but by dropping out, he assured that 15% of his supporters will now vote for Trump (myself included) and  a good percentage, who are &lt;a href=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieOrBust\&quot;&gt;#BernieOrBust&lt;/a&gt; will waste their votes in third party candidates; writing his name in or just will not vote at all. By dropping out; he just assured Trumps reelection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#39;s also been argued that Bernie dropped out to save lives ; that he did so because of COVID-19. This is bullshit to. 1.) Because he didn&amp;#39;t drop out until after Wisconsin; if the argument made any since; he already risks his supporters lives. 2.)  Since he still is staying on the primary ballots; his supporters, ; those who can&amp;#39;t vote my mail; will still risk their lives to vote for him. Additionally, staying on the ballot collecting delegates won&amp;#39;t win him any points; he already dropped out, losing all bartering power he might have had if he had stayed in... The only thing that makes since, is if he plans on doing a Ross Perot and planning on reentering the race later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry; Bernie is delusional if he thinks Biden understands or cares about any one. He didn&amp;#39;t say not to long ago that youth today are just a bunch of whiners. .He&amp;#39;s stated that he wants to cut social security, Medicaid, Medicare and other social assistance programs; he&amp;#39;s recent turn around on student loan debt, only helps out those who got into college; and not the millions who did not; he&amp;#39;s position on weed, will still put thousands of poor, mainly black men in prison;a prison system he help set up in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have fucking eight to ten years before irreversible climate disaster. if we don&amp;#39;t act now (like this term to implement a &amp;#39;Green New Deal&amp;#39;, people will star to die off in droves because of climate disaster. People will be displaced and become homeless because of climate disaster. Water will become so polluted... Air will become unbreakable... On top of that, 680,000 people will die within 10 years because of inadequate healthcare coverage. and that isn&amp;#39;t counting the millions who will die on top of that due to epidemics and pandemics which are more and more likely to occur because of the climate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Bernie dropped out; he has secured our fate. Even if he was elected; it would have taken a least four years to implement any of his GND or M4A policies; butting us at the far  end of the deadline to fix anything. 2024 will be too late to do anything; by the time the progressive candidate (if elected) could implement their policies, the planet will have passed the deadline Bernie screwed us all by dropping out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right; Bernie can&amp;#39;t hold his rally&amp;#39;s; and it is correct that we ca&amp;#39;t go knocking on doors; but he must have little faith in his army of online supporters that he doesn&amp;#39;t believe we can still influence people to our cause. We still have open social media and we can still could have phone bank for him. oh, what little trust he must have. What he has done is convinced millions to just stay home in November. My daughter will be turning 18 in November; she was a big time Bernie supporter; but now says she will NEVER vote. She is a girl of her word and Bernie has ruined her for the remainder of her life. &amp;quot;He had promised to stay in til the convention. He lied.&amp;quot; i have to agree with her...  I have spent months getting Trump and Biden  supports on team Berdie and after doing all that; they are now, going back to those they previously supported; the majority which being former MAGA people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because he gave up; he has guaranteed the deaths of so many people; and I not even talking about the people who will die in all the wars we are fighting; or the children in cages; people like my dad who current medicare won&amp;#39;t pay for his treatments; or even myself, who&amp;#39;s insurance doesn&amp;#39;t cover the same rare genetic disorder isn&amp;#39;t covered. At least we had a shot of surviving with Bernie. Now we are guaranteed dead within the net ten years.&quot;,
                        &quot;textOriginal&quot;: &quot;Long time Bernie supporter. But I call bullshit on many of his statements. First off, he has been over 300 delegates  behind for weeks now. There has bee zero change in that since the last primary; and none of the Wisconsin votes have even been released yet; so there is no evidence that is going to change one way or another. Second; he says he would do whatever he must do make sure that Donald rump doesn&#39;t win another term; but by dropping out, he assured that 15% of his supporters will now vote for Trump (myself included) and  a good percentage, who are #BernieOrBust will waste their votes in third party candidates; writing his name in or just will not vote at all. By dropping out; he just assured Trumps reelection. \n\nIt&#39;s also been argued that Bernie dropped out to save lives ; that he did so because of COVID-19. This is bullshit to. 1.) Because he didn&#39;t drop out until after Wisconsin; if the argument made any since; he already risks his supporters lives. 2.)  Since he still is staying on the primary ballots; his supporters, ; those who can&#39;t vote my mail; will still risk their lives to vote for him. Additionally, staying on the ballot collecting delegates won&#39;t win him any points; he already dropped out, losing all bartering power he might have had if he had stayed in... The only thing that makes since, is if he plans on doing a Ross Perot and planning on reentering the race later on.\n\nI am sorry; Bernie is delusional if he thinks Biden understands or cares about any one. He didn&#39;t say not to long ago that youth today are just a bunch of whiners. .He&#39;s stated that he wants to cut social security, Medicaid, Medicare and other social assistance programs; he&#39;s recent turn around on student loan debt, only helps out those who got into college; and not the millions who did not; he&#39;s position on weed, will still put thousands of poor, mainly black men in prison;a prison system he help set up in the first place. \n\nWe have fucking eight to ten years before irreversible climate disaster. if we don&#39;t act now (like this term to implement a &#39;Green New Deal&#39;, people will star to die off in droves because of climate disaster. People will be displaced and become homeless because of climate disaster. Water will become so polluted... Air will become unbreakable... On top of that, 680,000 people will die within 10 years because of inadequate healthcare coverage. and that isn&#39;t counting the millions who will die on top of that due to epidemics and pandemics which are more and more likely to occur because of the climate.  \n\nBecause Bernie dropped out; he has secured our fate. Even if he was elected; it would have taken a least four years to implement any of his GND or M4A policies; butting us at the far  end of the deadline to fix anything. 2024 will be too late to do anything; by the time the progressive candidate (if elected) could implement their policies, the planet will have passed the deadline Bernie screwed us all by dropping out. \n\nRight; Bernie can&#39;t hold his rally&#39;s; and it is correct that we ca&#39;t go knocking on doors; but he must have little faith in his army of online supporters that he doesn&#39;t believe we can still influence people to our cause. We still have open social media and we can still could have phone bank for him. oh, what little trust he must have. What he has done is convinced millions to just stay home in November. My daughter will be turning 18 in November; she was a big time Bernie supporter; but now says she will NEVER vote. She is a girl of her word and Bernie has ruined her for the remainder of her life. \&quot;He had promised to stay in til the convention. He lied.\&quot; i have to agree with her...

You have no way of proving this either. You keep saying proof and demonstration. Do you not get it yet? We are not supposed to know by those means. Why do we even bother with testimonies to get to the bottom of a case? Fallacy? Prove it. This time you prove it. Now you see God made faith incompatible with your way of thinking.&quot;,

You are still suck with at most a few years as a human out of an eternity as a god.  It is still a negligible amount of time as a human and therefore a negligable amount of sacrifice.  That&amp;#39;s all you&amp;#39;ve got?  That the infinitesimally small proportion of it&amp;#39;s existance it spent as a human would have been better as a god in heaven?  That is still an infintesimally small sacrifice.  Why should inbe grateful for a sacrifice that is functionally zero hardship to an eternal god?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes.  Serious question.  You seem to be judging itbfrom the perspective of a human who had no choice, not an eternal god who decided this from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, by your model we are whatvyour god chose us to be.  But remember, sin is just doing something the gid has arbitrarily chosen as the rules.  No sin in heaven just means that there is no free will in heaven. It is a celestial North Korea when everone must mindlessly obey a dictator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, no.  NDE&amp;#39;s can not be reasonably claimed to reveal truth.  In fact they are demostrably unreliable.  But your &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t make sense evwn if you are right. Why does an in ipotent gid need a test?  Why create a universe at all?  Why not simply create perfect spiritual beings direcrly in heaven?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead your god creates a universe and in one tiny corner sets a process in motion that will result in the temporary existance of beings that although created by god as god wants them are flawed and god then blames them for the flaws it gave them and punishes some for being given flaws and some, on the basis that they believe with out good evidence (because the god made the universe look exactly like a universe where a god doesn&amp;#39;t exist, just handing out selected ambiguous clues) get &amp;quot;rewarded&amp;quot; by spending an eternity as a slave with no free will?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but your religion is stupid.&quot;,

These people don&amp;#39;t follow religion much yet they came back with the same message from God. Same God. Atheist turns to religion after coming back. An atheist doctor becomes religious. An atheist professor becomes religious. I&amp;#39;m talking from the point of likelihood. We can&amp;#39;t have your criteria as I&amp;#39;ve stated before. It takes away faith which is important for spiritual development.&quot;,
                            &quot;textOriginal&quot;: &quot;@Edward The Booble You are dismissing everything. These people don&#39;t follow religion much yet they came back with the same message from God. Same God. Atheist turns to religion after coming back. An atheist doctor becomes religious. An atheist professor becomes religious. I&#39;m talking from the point of likelihood. We can&#39;t have your criteria as I&#39;ve stated before. It takes away faith which is important for spiritual development.&quot;,

He’s young enough right now that schoolwork and behavior is minor issues. But he is the class clown and always getting in trouble and doesn’t take any interest in school. I feel like he’s going to struggle more once school starts up again due to such a huge gap in learning. I’m scared for him going forward...I don’t want him to spiral out of control in his adolescence&quot;,

In addition, it&amp;#39;s possible a neutrino might be formed before the black hole stage, the neutrino being a substance with a very high gravitational modality with very low &amp;#39;em&amp;#39; modalities.)\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;(An alternative to the above would be to shoot 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#39;If&amp;#39; effects are noted, &amp;#39;then&amp;#39; further research could be done.\r&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#39;If&amp;#39; effects are not noted, &amp;#39;then&amp;#39; my latest TOE idea is wrong.  But still, we would know what &amp;#39;gravity&amp;#39; was not, which is still something in the scientific world.  Science still wins either way and moves forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised TOE: 3/25/2017a.\r&lt;br /&gt;My Current TOE:\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;THE SETUP:\r&lt;br /&gt;1. Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.\r&lt;br /&gt;2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it&amp;#39;s the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).\r&lt;br /&gt;3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.\r&lt;br /&gt;4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.\r&lt;br /&gt;5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:\r&lt;br /&gt;6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.\r&lt;br /&gt;7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron&amp;#39;s moving magnetic field.\r&lt;br /&gt;8. There are probably no such thing as &amp;quot;gluons&amp;quot; in actual reality.\r&lt;br /&gt;9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.\r&lt;br /&gt;10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.\r&lt;br /&gt;11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.\r&lt;br /&gt;12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:\r&lt;br /&gt;13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is &amp;quot;gravity&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, &amp;quot;gravity&amp;quot; flips and EM goes to minimum, then &amp;quot;gravity&amp;quot; flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it&amp;#39;s maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.\r&lt;br /&gt;14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling &amp;#39;gem&amp;#39; photon) is the energy unit in this universe.\r&lt;br /&gt;15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.\r&lt;br /&gt;16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.\r&lt;br /&gt;17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.\r&lt;br /&gt;18. Everything is basically &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; (photons) in a universe entirely filled with &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; (photons).\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:\r&lt;br /&gt;19. When the electron with it&amp;#39;s associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it&amp;#39;s associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.\r&lt;br /&gt;20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.\r&lt;br /&gt;21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;NOTES:\r&lt;br /&gt;22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&amp;#39;s magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r&lt;br /&gt;23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&amp;#39;s magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center&amp;#39;s black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r&lt;br /&gt;24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.\r&lt;br /&gt;25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven&amp;#39;t evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven&amp;#39;t evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren&amp;#39;t acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.\r&lt;br /&gt;26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:\r&lt;br /&gt;27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.&quot;,

It&#39;s the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, \&quot;gravity\&quot; flips and EM goes to minimum, then \&quot;gravity\&quot; flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it&#39;s maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.\r\n14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling &#39;gem&#39; photon) is the energy unit in this universe.\r\n15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.\r\n16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.\r\n17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.\r\n18. Everything is basically \&quot;light\&quot; (photons) in a universe entirely filled with \&quot;light\&quot; (photons).\r\n\r\nTHE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:\r\n19. When the electron with it&#39;s associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it&#39;s associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.\r\n20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.\r\n21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r\n23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center&#39;s black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r\n24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.\r\n25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren&#39;t acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.\r\n26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\n27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.&quot;,

I really enjoy your uploads! I’m looking to live in Los Angeles county, where Hollywood is! I am currently living in Orange County, and looking for a place to live in Los Angeles County. Yay, me! My whole life, I’ve always done everything by myself, literally, so that’s why I’m super proud that I figured out my, Destiny (All by myself). My Destiny is to get married to a few guys, all at once, and be the perfect happy family. Those guys are, Tom Ellis (he is a London actor on a hit-show in America called, Lucifer), Hugh Bonneville and Jim Carter (they are 2 really handsome gentlemen on the show, Downton Abbey), Louis Garrel (he is super famous London actor on the movie, Dreamers), and then I am also to marry, Henry Cavill and Johnathan Rhys Meyers (they are super hot guys on the huge show, The Tudors). I will become their Wife, and Mother to our children (it’ll be my first time being a Mom). So far, we have 3 daughters. I am also going to, finally, become a, famous, American, Actress on the big screen. The second thing in my Destiny is to be a real, live, Queen, for the United Kingdom. I was born to do all of these things :D, so it is in my blood. I’m Middle class, and I AM, social climbing, so I will, marry the first rich man I come in to contact with, of course. HAHA! Either way my story plays out, I WILL END UP MARRIED TO THESE MEN, POST HASTE! That is a promise. I’m 31 years old, and I’m not just any Millennial, I’m, THAT, Millennial! You can join me wherever you see me in person :D ! See you on the big screen :D ! Family. Love. Love. Love &amp;lt;3 . \r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;signed,\r&lt;br /&gt;Brittney Hill, Monday, March the 23rd, 2020, Becoming, a Famous, Screen Actress, and Royal.&quot;,

I’m looking to live in Los Angeles county, where Hollywood is! I am currently living in Orange County, and looking for a place to live in Los Angeles County. Yay, me! My whole life, I’ve always done everything by myself, literally, so that’s why I’m super proud that I figured out my, Destiny (All by myself). My Destiny is to get married to a few guys, all at once, and be the perfect happy family. Those guys are, Tom Ellis (he is a London actor on a hit-show in America called, Lucifer), Hugh Bonneville and Jim Carter (they are 2 really handsome gentlemen on the show, Downton Abbey), Louis Garrel (he is super famous London actor on the movie, Dreamers), and then I am also to marry, Henry Cavill and Johnathan Rhys Meyers (they are super hot guys on the huge show, The Tudors). I will become their Wife, and Mother to our children (it’ll be my first time being a Mom). So far, we have 3 daughters. I am also going to, finally, become a, famous, American, Actress on the big screen. The second thing in my Destiny is to be a real, live, Queen, for the United Kingdom. I was born to do all of these things :D, so it is in my blood. I’m Middle class, and I AM, social climbing, so I will, marry the first rich man I come in to contact with, of course. HAHA! Either way my story plays out, I WILL END UP MARRIED TO THESE MEN, POST HASTE! That is a promise. I’m 31 years old, and I’m not just any Millennial, I’m, THAT, Millennial! You can join me wherever you see me in person :D ! See you on the big screen :D ! Family. Love. Love. Love &amp;lt;3 . \r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;signed,\r&lt;br /&gt;Brittney Hill, Monday, March the 16th, 2020, Becoming, a Famous, Screen Actress, and Royal.&quot;,

I am also going to, finally, become a, famous, American, Actress on the big screen. The second thing in my Destiny is to be a real, live, Queen, for the United Kingdom. I was born to do all of these things :D, so it is in my blood. I’m Middle class, and I AM, social climbing, so I will, marry the first rich man I come in to contact with, of course. HAHA! Either way my story plays out, I WILL END UP MARRIED TO THESE MEN, POST HASTE! That is a promise. I’m 31 years old, and I’m not just any Millennial, I’m, THAT, Millennial! You can join me wherever you see me in person :D ! See you on the big screen :D ! Family. Love. Love. Love &lt;3 . \r\n\r\nsigned,\r\nBrittney Hill, Monday, March the 16th, 2020, Becoming, a Famous, Screen Actress, and Royal.&quot;,

I&amp;#39;ve been working for this company on the internet for 24 months now and I never been happier... They are paying me $95 per hour, and the best thing about it is the fact I am not that tech-savvy, they just asked for basic knowledge about internet and plain typing skill...Great thing about this work is that I have more free time with my kids. I am able to spend quality time with my relatives and buddies and take care of my children and also going on holiday vacation together with them very frequently. Don&amp;#39;t ignore this opportunity  and make sure to act fast. This is what I do... &lt;b&gt;explore486­.­c­o­m&lt;/b&gt;&quot;,
