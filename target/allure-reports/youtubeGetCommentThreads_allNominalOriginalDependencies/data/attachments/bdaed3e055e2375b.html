If a dna test was conducted then each &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; would contain the &amp;quot;old you&amp;quot;. unless you used bodies from other sources.  But theoretically, If you split your brain into two , then used your (1) body , then you would have to choose if you wanted to give your body to the left half of your brain or the right half. then the unchosen half would need a body because you had two halves of brain and only one body.  To answer your question using my logic, the half of a brain with your full body is 100% you. Just severely handicapped, mentally. The other half of your brain with an outsourced body, is  whatever percentage the average human brain to body ratio is divided by half, because its just one half of a brain. Say the human brain consists of 4% (im guessing) of the human body , then your brain half with a strangers body would still be 4% you, minus 2% you because its half of a brain.Thus, it would be 2% you (given that my guess is correct that a full human brain is 4% the mass of average human) . Stay with me here. Say you just threw away your body down the trash chute, and used two average sized bodies , then each human with your half a brain inside would be only roughly 2% you. If a dna blood, hair, saliva etc.test was conducted on both those bodies then it would still not be you, Unless the dna conductor took dna samples of the brains. then the Samples would be 100% you. Furthermore, both humans would be in a wheelchair for life because the left half of brains control the entire right side of human bodies. and vice versa. But to make the situation fun, lets imagine that each human had full capability of moving their entire body with on e half brain. The left brain human would probably grow up to be  mathematician, or a foreign language translator, and the other right half brain human would become the next pablo picasso  or next beethoven, or even a gangster rapper. &quot;,
