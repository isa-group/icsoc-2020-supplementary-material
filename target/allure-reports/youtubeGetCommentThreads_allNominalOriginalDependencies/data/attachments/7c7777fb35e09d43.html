In addition to all that, Trump is sacrificing formally solid alliances with our Allies and friends, while enabling and strengthening the enemies of the United States. Last, but far from least, Trump is enriching himself and his family by exploiting  the Presidency: he has breached the emoluments clause of the Constitution on numerous occasions by, for example, using taxpayer money to fund his numerous golfing trips to Mar-a-lago.

That&amp;#39;s the Russian lies and manipulations engineered on our election system already proven by our Intelligence Agencies. Hillary has been thoroughly investigated for over three decades including the travesty employed by GOP Congress headed by Trey Gowdy just prior to the elections, squandering US$Millions of Taxpayers money and the vast investigative powers of the country including the FBI, and the NSA. And all they came up with was the fu#*ing emails. E-mails which, by the way, the GOP used during Dubya&amp;#39;s tenure and still being used by this current administration including Ivanka. Hillary also honored the Congressional Subpoenas and produced the requested documents as well as testified in US Congress for over 24 hours duration whereas Trump and his Lackeys can&amp;#39;t even do one. Trump&amp;#39;s lawyers defense in not allowing him to testify was that Trump would be liable to  a charge of perjury as he would inevitably LIE. He is programmed to lie. What a defense! So instead, Republicans like McConnell again paved the way clear for Trump. Trump has fought the Subpoenas for years now when he said (LIED again) that he would release his documents if he was elected. He still hasn&amp;#39;t and US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has conveniently blocked all attempts at subpoenas and US Dept of Justice head Bill Barr has been fixing Trump&amp;#39;s problems away (IMHO) since then including blocking the outright investigation of the election with Mitch McConnell&amp;#39;s help, among others.&quot;,
