Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem.  For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace – all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.&lt;br /&gt;So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump&amp;#39;s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing – not once, ever.&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility – for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.&lt;br /&gt;But with Trump, it&amp;#39;s a fact. He doesn&amp;#39;t even seem to understand what a joke is – his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.  Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.&lt;br /&gt;And scarily, he doesn&amp;#39;t just talk in crude, witless insults – he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.  There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It&amp;#39;s all surface.&lt;br /&gt;Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.  Well, we don&amp;#39;t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.  And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.  Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.  He&amp;#39;s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.  He&amp;#39;s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.&lt;br /&gt;And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.  That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.&lt;br /&gt;There are unspoken rules to this stuff – the Queensberry rules of basic decency – and he breaks them all. He punches downwards – which a gentleman should, would, could never do – and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless or female – and he kicks them when they are down.  So the fact that a significant minority – perhaps a third – of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think &amp;#39;Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy&amp;#39; is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:&lt;br /&gt;• Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and most are.&lt;br /&gt;• You don&amp;#39;t need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.&lt;br /&gt;This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.&lt;br /&gt;After all, it&amp;#39;s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.  God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.  He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart.  In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws – he would make a Trump.&quot;,

                            &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;@SouthCountyGal I have nothing against people drinking. It&amp;#39;s just that when you&amp;#39;re performing, particularly on screen, you have a lot to keep in mind at the same time: your lines (even from cue cards, it has to look seamless), where the cameras are, where the frame is (he has a monitor, but it&amp;#39;s still not easy to make it look easy), staying in the right light, anticipating guests&amp;#39; questions, reacting to something unplanned without breaking character, and so forth. And Colbert&amp;#39;s also a producer. If a problem occurs, it&amp;#39;s partly up to him to address it, or at least to choose what to do. That&amp;#39;s why it seems unlikely that he drinks real whiskey. Seeing him drink a tiny bit also makes it look more real. If he were drinking a whole glass, it would of course be fake. But then, he takes so little each time, that even if the drink were real, I doubt it would affect him at all. You can see that the level in the glass never visibly goes down. So it could also be a real cocktail that he pretends to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Maher loves to go on about how much he likes pot, but he&amp;#39;s always completely clear-headed when he&amp;#39;s doing his show. The stakes are just too high and it&amp;#39;s live. If you ever see characters drinking a lot of alcohol on screen, it&amp;#39;s usually fake, particularly if it&amp;#39;s live or if several takes are needed. I did a high school play where the director had two characters enjoy a glass of Scotch together (this was not in the US, where people would have fainted at the very idea) and iced tea was used. A famous exception is the Rick and Morty episode from season 3 &amp;quot;Vindicators 3: the Return of Worldender&amp;quot;. In that episode, Rick leaves videos of himself completely drunk, so drunk that he himself does not remember what happened. Justin Roiland, the co-creator and co-producer of Rick and Morty, who also voices both characters, decided that he&amp;#39;d try method acting for that part and got completely drunk for the voice recording, even though his voice director begged him not to. The voice director then described it as, &amp;quot;The least productive day of my career.&amp;quot; You can find videos of the recording. It&amp;#39;s actually funny, but you can see they&amp;#39;re not getting much done. Roiland ended up hating the episode for other reason, mostly because the narrative structure is wrong, according to him. I love it. But I assume they could have recorded it just as well and with less trouble with a sober Roiland.&quot;,

Justin Roiland, the co-creator and co-producer of Rick and Morty, who also voices both characters, decided that he&#39;d try method acting for that part and got completely drunk for the voice recording, even though his voice director begged him not to. The voice director then described it as, \&quot;The least productive day of my career.\&quot; You can find videos of the recording. It&#39;s actually funny, but you can see they&#39;re not getting much done. Roiland ended up hating the episode for other reason, mostly because the narrative structure is wrong, according to him. I love it. But I assume they could have recorded it just as well and with less trouble with a sober Roiland.&quot;,

Actually, Donald created a mess and a crisis: he declined to use the World Health Organization’s test like other nations.

By the end of February, the WHO had shipped out tests to 60 countries. Oh, but donald. He declined the test even as a temporary bridge until the CDC could create its own test. In 2018 Donald fired Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossart, whose job was to coordinate a response to global pandemics. He was not replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2018 Dr. Luciana Borio, the NSC director for medical and bio-defense preparedness left the job.

He never claimed Trump was trying to kill minorities and promote white nationalism, that&amp;#39;s Fox News rhetoric wanting you to believe that all left is far left, that there are no moderates. He claimed Trump incompetency is failing this country, which it is. Were you somewhere far away in the months leading up to the present situation? Did you miss the briefings and rallies where Trump said the situation is a nonissue and at one point even called the virus response a hoax by the Democrats? Did you miss Trump telling the WHO that America doesnt want or need the testing kits they were offering? Do you deny that Trump dismantled the pandemic response team from the previous administration? Mustve been somewhere else. And who should be surprised? He&amp;#39;s not a politician, hes a reality TV star. People voted for him based on his business acumen, which is ironic because its well-documented how many times he has bankrupted on business projects, fucked over entire companies that worked with him on those business projects, and either got bailed out by the banks or his father.&quot;,
