China&amp;#39;s been lying to us from the get go. They assured us and their servants at the W.H.O that covid-19 did not spread from person to person. Second per capita, America has a fairly low death rate 4.1%. near the bottom of the list of top 13 countries hit.  As more people are tested, it&amp;#39;ll fall in line with seasonal influenza. In order to have an accurate mortality rate, you need a death number (numerator) and a total infected number (denominator). We have the numerator, we aren&amp;#39;t even close to knowing the denominator. So, you&amp;#39;re a moron and you write like a 3rd grader. You should NEVER talk about I.Q with the sentences you write. Mmmkay pal?&quot;,

Because of all the action we&#39;re taking to stack the deck in our favour, we&#39;re actually emotionally pretty chill. Like, knowing we&#39;ve covered all the ground we personally can makes it a lot easier to just give the rest to G_d, &amp; sleep well. \r\nIt only seems obsessive if you lose sight of the fact that the stakes could literally be life + death for us. And at the end of the day, it&#39;s just a bunch of extra housework; we don&#39;t let paranoia rule us, we just do our chores &amp; then get on with our lives. You do what you have to, to protect your mental health. :-)&quot;,

I mean look at Nancy Poloci trying to get a stimulus past that will help all rich people. In the stimulus that was passed by our President giving everyone something she and that party tried to slip in shit that did not have anything to do with the Corona virus, Trump caught it and said NO he would not sign on that as it had all the green house stuff in it and guess who was behind it none other then Nancy Poloci and the gang. The Democrats are nothing but evil and in November yes we will remember with a vote for Trump and we will make sure the house is Republican controlled and keep the Senate that way. This is the year the Democrats will be out period, anyone that can support a democrat knowing what they stand for is lost, they stand for DEMON POWER as DEMO means DEMON and CRAT means POWER, look it up DEMO in Latin and CRAT in Greek. That name actually fits them well and their beliefs that are totally against God, God does not support Abortion the killing of innocent children nor does he support same sex marriages nor relationships of that nature, Sodom and Gammorah is an example of that. Anyway thank you for bringing that to our attention even though we wont forget come November. Trump 2020 along with the house and senate.&quot;,

Listen I don&amp;#39;t think Trump is the best at being president and as a physician, I take offense to much of what the man says, but in this case he is actually at least trying to do what is in his power at this point. You have to remember that with an R knot of 2, one should not expect an enveloped rna virus to withstand heat, UV rays and remain transmissible for up to 37 days. That is what makes this strain of coronaviridae so unnerving to me and many others. Irrespective of this, and taking into account of the vast number of mild or absent ssx cases, one can assume then the fatality rate is orders of magnitude lower than what is reported, as well as that the prevalence to incidence ratio will eventually taper down. This is just another respiratory virus that we need to be vigilant for especially for those who are the elderly or in any way immunocompromised.&quot;,
