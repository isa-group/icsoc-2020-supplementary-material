                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;Masks, gloves, ventilators, hospital gowns, bed sheets, trash bags and toilet paper can all be made quickly and efficiently from Cannabis Sativa in every country on Earth. Marijuana prohibition since World War II has forced our global industries to be dependent on fossil fuels for transportation, energy and plastic, as well as trees for paper and construction, creating the atmospheric imbalance over the last 100 years that is causing climate change today. When the US faced a shortage of supplies during World War II, the US Federal government suspended Cannabis prohibition and encouraged Americans to grow hemp to make rope, uniforms, ruck sacks, boot laces and parachute harnesses for the military.\r&lt;br /&gt;The license to grow hemp that was issued by the USDA read, &amp;quot;Producer of Marihuana&amp;quot;. Just five years after &amp;quot;Marihuana&amp;quot; was outlawed as a dangerous substance that would destroy America, hundreds of thousands of acres of legal &amp;quot;Marihuana&amp;quot; were grown to save the US and the world, and we can accomplish even more with this resource today.\r Growing hemp for food, fuel, fiber, plastic and paper will do far more for cleaning pollution out of the environment than simply not driving.\r While everyone is isolated in their homes, grow hemp in your yards, like Victory Gardens during WWII, to make each nation more self-sufficient and better prepared for future emergencies.\r&lt;br /&gt;Everyone can contribute this way, regardless of ethnicity, religion, nationality, political affiliation, gender or age.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;NASA timeline of CO2 accumulation which coincides with industrialization and Cannabis prohibition: &lt;a href=\&quot;https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/\&quot;&gt;https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/\r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;US Dept of Defense report on the growing threat of climate change: &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/downloads/CCARprint_wForward_e.pdf\&quot;&gt;https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/downloads/CCARprint_wForward_e.pdf\r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UN report on the growing threat of climate change: &lt;a href=\&quot;https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1031322\&quot;&gt;https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1031322\r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AR5 Synthesis Report: Climate Change 2014 &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/\&quot;&gt;https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/\r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act, 2018: &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3174\&quot;&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3174\r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hemp as an Agricultural Commodity.

                        &quot;textOriginal&quot;: &quot;Masks, gloves, ventilators, hospital gowns, bed sheets, trash bags and toilet paper can all be made quickly and efficiently from Cannabis Sativa in every country on Earth. Marijuana prohibition since World War II has forced our global industries to be dependent on fossil fuels for transportation, energy and plastic, as well as trees for paper and construction, creating the atmospheric imbalance over the last 100 years that is causing climate change today. When the US faced a shortage of supplies during World War II, the US Federal government suspended Cannabis prohibition and encouraged Americans to grow hemp to make rope, uniforms, ruck sacks, boot laces and parachute harnesses for the military.\r\nThe license to grow hemp that was issued by the USDA read, \&quot;Producer of Marihuana\&quot;. Just five years after \&quot;Marihuana\&quot; was outlawed as a dangerous substance that would destroy America, hundreds of thousands of acres of legal \&quot;Marihuana\&quot; were grown to save the US and the world, and we can accomplish even more with this resource today.\r Growing hemp for food, fuel, fiber, plastic and paper will do far more for cleaning pollution out of the environment than simply not driving.\r While everyone is isolated in their homes, grow hemp in your yards, like Victory Gardens during WWII, to make each nation more self-sufficient and better prepared for future emergencies.\r\nEveryone can contribute this way, regardless of ethnicity, religion, nationality, political affiliation, gender or age.\r\n\r\nNASA timeline of CO2 accumulation which coincides with industrialization and Cannabis prohibition: https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/\r\nUS Dept of Defense report on the growing threat of climate change: https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/downloads/CCARprint_wForward_e.pdf\r\nUN report on the growing threat of climate change: https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1031322\r\nAR5 Synthesis Report: Climate Change 2014 https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/\r\nMarijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act, 2018: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3174\r\nHemp as an Agricultural Commodity.

It&amp;#39;s absolutely ridiculous to think that he&amp;#39;s saying this stuff under duress. As soon as I watched that press conference, I knew that the media was going to write a new story to explain it, and sure enough, it&amp;#39;s a lie. Just look at what he said. Did Trump mitigate when Fauci asked him to... yes. Did Trump add another 30 days of mitigation when Fauci asked him to... yes. Both of those things are true, and that&amp;#39;s without the revelation that it was these same people who were recommending banning travel to different areas. Trump has actually finally made some good decisions, but right or wrong, they&amp;#39;re wrong because he&amp;#39;s Trump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&amp;#39;re projecting a number of deaths now that is drastically less than the models, we have more ventilators and beds than we&amp;#39;re projected to need. We have fewer cases and deaths than the next five countries combined, which coincidentally have a combined population almost equal to ours. Why can&amp;#39;t that just be good news? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody likes Trump. That&amp;#39;s old news. It&amp;#39;s easy to hate him and everything he does, so that&amp;#39;s the coward&amp;#39;s position. People with courage look at each decision and judge fairly, in spite of peer pressure.

Here&amp;#39;s some food for thought regarding takeout: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of our concerns about the health of the economy and keeping people in food service employed, let&amp;#39;s be real. An infected person prepping or handling the food you&amp;#39;re ordering can shed the virus on the food itself. The virus sometimes lands inside storage, prepping, or delivery containers, on bowls, cooking tools, and the outside of food-handling gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the expression &amp;quot;I worked in a restaurant kitchen, so I don&amp;#39;t eat food from one&amp;quot;? I think a person is nuts if they have the option of carefully prepping the food themselves but choose not to do so for almost any reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying and playing it&amp;#39;s safe requires that you control whatever you can and hope for the best. You are not in effective preventative control if you&amp;#39;re choosing to have random unseen people who may be unintentionally transferring the virus from themselves, others, or from contaminated surfaces on to yummy takeout your about to chow down on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Researchers have learned that one out of every two people (50%) in a population can be infected with the virus without knowing it, and that 4 out of 5  (80%) of those infected only experience mild symptoms. These people are contaminating things and infecting others without knowing they are doing so. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many workers having mild symptoms and worry they have the virus, but without testing to confirm it they will not definitely lose their jobs. Some of these are food service people, and it is unreasonable to assume they being as careful as they need to be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The danger with takeout food is real, and it goes beyond the packaging. The currently promoted suggestions for how to avoid the virus are not strong, prudent and effective enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, the virus can stay &amp;quot;infectable&amp;quot; for 3 hours while traveling in the air.. at whatever speed the air is moving. Six feet is only about how far a person can actively project the virus out you. However, yes, a person could have sneezed in a small room two hours ago and you can walk in and can get infected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom-line is that if you are absolutely taking a risk of food being contaminated with the virus. Cleaning the exterior of the packaging doesn&amp;#39;t protect you any more than washing your skin gets the virus out from already inside you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Control what you can. Don&amp;#39;t become a sad statistic. Don&amp;#39;t take stupid risks. You won&amp;#39;t die by ignore your craving for takeout. I&amp;#39;d rather be more tired than risk being on a ventilator like hundreds of thousands of people around the world were or are now.&quot;,

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;People have to see that there a huge life and death consequences to shutting down an entire nation.  Essential workers won&amp;#39;t be able to stay home but if those who make ventilators and PPE now (who were in the business of manufacturing something entirely different before) would fall under the stay at home order technically.  Furthermore, when the economy shuts down, poverty goes up and guess what?  Crime goes up!  Not as many people will be dying of Covid-19 perhaps but they will be dying of suicide, stabbings, etc.  Even more people would be unemployed and struggling than there are now.  When Dr. Fauci said they &amp;quot;we look at it from a pure health standpoint&amp;quot;, you may interpret it as him covering his ass with Trump but Doctors all look at things from a &amp;quot;pure health standpoint&amp;quot; meaning not taking consideration of any other factors that affect our livelihood.  i.e. to a Chiropractor, no back is straight the way it should be and it will never be because we are standing and not on 4 legs.  Does it mean we should start walking on all fours?  No.  My podiatrist tells me that i have extremely flat feet and I can get inserts (here&amp;#39;s the thing it doesn&amp;#39;t fit into any of my shoes-not even sneakers).  Even if they did, for a women to not ever wear anything else is unrealistic. My doctor tells me losing weight will alleviate the pain but I shouldn&amp;#39;t be running nor taking walks because that will aggravate my ankle.  anyway, my point is...if you ask a Doctor they will always tell you what they prefer you to do which may be not to go back to work for 3 years to recover but in real life, we need to follow that advice but not to the extreme extent where you ignore other factors that can cause more damage if ignored.  The solution cannot be the problem.  There will be give in take if you want everything to work out later on.  You don&amp;#39;t want to create more problems that (no one sees today) can be just as deadly.  Oh and Trump isn&amp;#39;t just one man, he speaks for many Americans who feels the same way.  If a good number of the American people didn&amp;#39;t feel that way, he wouldn&amp;#39;t have the power to do anything or get into office in the first place.  Also, he has to speak to 50+ governors on shutting down the country and the midwestern states aren&amp;#39;t affected as heavily by this so those governors are not in agreement.  He can&amp;#39;t just ignore them and tell them to shutdown just cause.  that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense.&quot;,

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;I just got my &amp;quot;self isolation 10 day recommendation&amp;quot;. Thank God I didn&amp;#39;t get the 14 day quarantine order in which I would be required to do the same thing for 4 more days! I&amp;#39;m in Canada where 50 some odd billions of dollars are being released to the 37 million citizens and my job doesn&amp;#39;t qualify for the check. Free phone call screening with my BC healthcare card, but all symptoms are treatable with over the counter herbal tea and unicorn farts but a note for my employer costs $20 from the Colebrook Clinic. I don&amp;#39;t qualify for a ticket for the line to testing center, but once you get through that line of people who only got the privilege of testing because of escalating symptoms, it&amp;#39;s sink or swim. The news tells me that a car plat that makes a million cars per year will make 20,000 ventilators by the end of the year and 30,000 next year. This is to deliver oxygen to patients. Home Depot sells microbial filters for Shop-Vac brand industrial vacuum cleaners and the vacuum cleaners themselves! For sanitary purposes don&amp;#39;t use any old handyman&amp;#39;s Shop-Vac. But the reverse setting turns the machine into an air filter that blows enough filtered air to put clean air into 3-4 bedrooms, or ventilators if you want to be a jerk about it. I understand the argument for medical sanitation, but this is an emergency and the treatment is air with a little more oxygen added. So pressurised oxygen tanks and air compressors, vacuums with microbial filters, these are off the shelf tech that could save thousands of lives, but I have to make the psychological gymnastics to figure out morally surviving in Surrey BC where targeted assassinations are fairly common.&quot;,

I don&#39;t qualify for a ticket for the line to testing center, but once you get through that line of people who only got the privilege of testing because of escalating symptoms, it&#39;s sink or swim. The news tells me that a car plat that makes a million cars per year will make 20,000 ventilators by the end of the year and 30,000 next year. This is to deliver oxygen to patients. Home Depot sells microbial filters for Shop-Vac brand industrial vacuum cleaners and the vacuum cleaners themselves! For sanitary purposes don&#39;t use any old handyman&#39;s Shop-Vac. But the reverse setting turns the machine into an air filter that blows enough filtered air to put clean air into 3-4 bedrooms, or ventilators if you want to be a jerk about it. I understand the argument for medical sanitation, but this is an emergency and the treatment is air with a little more oxygen added. So pressurised oxygen tanks and air compressors, vacuums with microbial filters, these are off the shelf tech that could save thousands of lives, but I have to make the psychological gymnastics to figure out morally surviving in Surrey BC where targeted assassinations are fairly common.&quot;,

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;We need to stop virus transmission with masks and touch hygiene but this should not be accomplished by exacerbating the infection of victims if at all possible. New types of fiber&lt;br /&gt;filter masks and HAZMAT Level C/B respirator masks must be designed and manufactured&lt;br /&gt;to prevent infected people from transmitting the virus to others without forcing the repeated inhalation of the virus from the mask. The N95 respirator mask with a valve, although very effective in preventing infection, does not filter the exhausted breath so it does not prevent transmission if you become infected. Moreover, both the N95 and surgical masks will trap the virus so that viral droplets are re-inhaled into the lungs of the victim where it could exponentially increase the viral load and severity of the infection yielding higher mortality rates. The N95 valve helps limit virus accumulation inside the mask so it should be altered to exhaust the contaminated breath into a filter “pillow” attached to the outside of the exhaust valve to capture the virus laden spittle and airborne virus away from the inhalation portion of the mask. The exhaust filter can further protect the N95 filter from projectile droplets and reduce the potential for transmission to others or back to one’s own lungs. In the short term, you could add a surgical mask on top of your N95 valve or even add two cloth masks with a hole in the first one to allow breath vented from the valve to be trapped between the two surgical masks. Once you know you’re infected any fiber mask should be replaced regularly to reduce viral load available for inhalation. The better, and likely cheaper option in the long&lt;br /&gt;run, is the use of a true HAZMAT Level C/B full or half face respirator mask that has a disinfecting filter cartridge added over the exhaust valve to prevent viral transmission from the wearer. These masks have much better virus exclusion due to the silicone seal and use long lasting filter cartridges that are more effective than fiber masks and are safer to handle and dispose once contaminated. Ha, finally found a nice Honeywell full face respirator and I modified a “Piggyback Adapter” to add an N95 pre-filter HEPA disk to the exhaust valve housing for a mask that filters equally well on the inflow and outflow without cross contamination. The adapter needs to be 3D printed or extruded in one piece so it fits the exhaust housing without a flimsy glue bond between the mated parts. If a barbed hose bib were added to these masks, it would allow external attachment of an oxygen supply tube. Removal of an inflow filter cartridge would allow attachment of a ventilator hose. An everyman PPE kit should be composed of: two modified N95s w/exhaust filter, eye protection, gloves infused with antiviral solution, and a 2 oz. nebulizer with the antiviral solution to refresh the gloves. This kit would cost &amp;lt;$10 and wide distribution might be able to reduce the transmission rate sufficiently to eliminate the viral reservoir in the population. The Level C/B respirator modification is necessary to reduce the mortality rate in patients and to allow the medical staff to continue working safely, even if they get infected and are asymptomatic. I’m&lt;br /&gt;not a medical professional so please validate these suggestions with Dr. Fauci at &amp;#39;afauci@niaid.nih.gov&amp;#39;.&quot;,

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;If we go by trump&amp;#39;s track record on dealing with this pandemic we are all screwed.&lt;br /&gt;This list of screw up is long and keeps growing every time trump opens his mouth.  Note that closing the boarder with China was too little too late because he &lt;b&gt;FAILED&lt;/b&gt; to have testing in place. I know that trump supporters will hail that at if it was the greatest decision ever but it did NOTHING to stop the spread in the US since it was already here. Trump supporters only want to see what they want and will desperately try to avoid the reality that their dear leader is a &lt;b&gt;F’ck Up!&lt;/b&gt; If you want to see what a real leader is like watch Governor Andrew Cuomo’s daily press briefing on this Pandemic then compare that to your IDIOT trump’s clown show of lies and nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How trump &lt;b&gt;SCREW UP &amp;amp; FAILED&lt;/b&gt; at every step with this Pandemic. Lives will be lost because of his incompetence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* STEALING PPE’s:* It is now being reported that trump’s administration is stealing orders of PPE’s. Orders are begin redirected by the WH and nobody know where they are going. Last week Germany and France reported that their orders were seized and redirected to the US. Nobody knows where these PPE’s are actually going. Trump early on accused NY doctors and nurses were stealing or hording PPE’s to cover up the fact that he failed to deliver on his promises for PPE’s. Now we know that he is behind the shortages making this worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;US Accused of hijacking coronavirus supplies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1sLA2wyWaI\&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1sLA2wyWaI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;US is accused of hijacking shipments of masks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhKN4UTXFjQ\&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhKN4UTXFjQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;France Accuses US of Buying Up Chinese Masks Bound for France&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://youtu.be/OkPYm2lKlts\&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/OkPYm2lKlts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump eviscerated the CDC budget in 2017&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump eliminated the Pandemic Emergency Response Team along with all the expertise on epidemics/pandemics in 2017&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump ended an early warning program just 2 months before the covid-19 started spreading is Wuhan, China. This would have saved millions of lives. &lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* Trump was warned of this in December and again in January and instead of taking actions did less than nothing as all the screw up listed below. EVERYONE saw this coming except trump.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP: Just the 4 things I’ve mentioned so far show an incredible lack of understanding and complete incompetence. He could not of done more harm than if it were intentional but his list of failures continue and there are many.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* China notified WHO and the CDC that they identified the virus and released the genome sequence so that countries can make tests to detect the new virus. Trump the F’k Up did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCREW UP:&lt;/b&gt; Even after the Pandemic was clear trump cut the budget for the CDC and healthcare.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* W.H.O. recommended a proven test kit but the CDC rejected it and decided to make their own and it failed to work. This was perhaps the biggest mistake of all. &lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump didn&amp;#39;t want people to be tested cause that would make the number of people infected go up.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump down played the threat and discouraged early action that could have been take so we would have been better prepared.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump has been lying to the public and giving bad advice. He continues to lie and mislead the public in all his press briefings.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* He ordered a stand down in the face of a Pandemic demonstrating that he is too stupid to understand what we are up against.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump to the public that anyone can go to a doctor or hospital to get tested. He lied, there were no test kits available. &lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* Closing the boarder with China then with Europe was cosmetic move and useless without having any testing. Testing was and is the single most important tool in fighting this but trump didn’t want to do testing cause it might make the numbers go up.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* according the statistical analysis over 95% of death from this pandemic will be directly the fault of trump and his destructive actions.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* The great trump economy is a complete washout. It fell below January 2017 levels. Trump made the markets much worse because of his incompetence and gross mishandling of this crisis in every way imaginable.  &lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump continues to lie to the public and promoting drugs that have not been tested for the coronavirus. As a result he has created a shortage of much needed drugs for other problems which can and will cause other people to die. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://youtu.be/2Yph4FqskDc\&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/2Yph4FqskDc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doctor Calls Trump’s Claims Quackery and Dangerous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump continues to refuse to listen to medical advice on this pandemic. This is putting the public at greater danger. His recklessness is killing people.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP* FEMA had a deal to make ventilators then the IDIOT trump put jared kushner in charge to then said no. Now the 80,000 ventilators wont be ready in time when we need them. &lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* A vaccine funded by taxpayer money the CORRUPT trump gave a patient to a private company that will prevent people from getting it. &lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump is giving medical advice that has not been proven to work. Dr. Fauci said prior it is not advisable to take such drugs that have not been tested. When asked at a WH Briefing trump would not let Dr. Fauci answer the question about the drugs trump is pushing.  The testing of Hydroxychloquine stopped due to creating heart problems in people. So, the IDIOT trump’s advice could kill people.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* Continues to fail to deliver respirators as promised and has a temper tantrum and storms out of the press briefing when asked about the delays and then storms out of the press briefing. &lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP: * After trump urges people to try Hydroxychloquine a man in Arizona tried it and died.  &lt;a href=\&quot;https://youtu.be/iSI5m5UbaQ4\&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/iSI5m5UbaQ4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* trump continues to lie about testing and respirators.&lt;br /&gt;* LIES by trump’s own mouth:* &lt;a href=\&quot;https://youtu.be/kKD25397CZQ\&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/kKD25397CZQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCREW UP:&lt;/b&gt; On April 14 trump brasenily used the corona press briefing to show a propaganda video filled with disinformation (LIES) to promote himself. Considering how how he as screwed up every way possible he has to resort to propaganda videos.&lt;br /&gt;* SCREW UP:* there will still be trump turds that will defend their dear lead to the bitter end and that is proof of just how stupid they are. They also hate this country. They are delighting in seeing the US’s destruction and the thousands of deaths because of trump’s incompetence and stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The “great trump economy” &lt;b&gt;As of April 9, 2020 over 16 Million people filed for unemployment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Global Health Expert: Testing Fundamental To Beating COVID-19&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://youtu.be/RQT-0k9CerM\&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/RQT-0k9CerM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the Government Botched the Coronavirus Response (LegalEagle’s Real Law Review)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://youtu.be/r4EVn03aCJg\&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/r4EVn03aCJg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the U.S. botched its COVID-19 response&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://youtu.be/JYW7PhIGNfw\&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/JYW7PhIGNfw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Mike Hansen: US did nothing for over 2 months (Reported Mar 16, 2020)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Who Should Get Tested?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://youtu.be/P2hXnt9xrvY\&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/P2hXnt9xrvY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 28, 2020 CDC Dr Anthony Fauci said there can be as many as 100,000 to 200,000 dead.  Virtually all will be the idiot trump’s fault because he is a complete SCREW  UP! Trump is a complete FAILURE as president. Everything is going wrong, 10’s of thousand will die because of trump and the great trump economy is worse than the 2008 crash. This because trump is incompetent, an idiot, and a sociopath who is incapable of learning.

                        &quot;textOriginal&quot;: &quot;If we go by trump&#39;s track record on dealing with this pandemic we are all screwed.\nThis list of screw up is long and keeps growing every time trump opens his mouth.  Note that closing the boarder with China was too little too late because he *FAILED* to have testing in place. I know that trump supporters will hail that at if it was the greatest decision ever but it did NOTHING to stop the spread in the US since it was already here. Trump supporters only want to see what they want and will desperately try to avoid the reality that their dear leader is a *F’ck Up!* If you want to see what a real leader is like watch Governor Andrew Cuomo’s daily press briefing on this Pandemic then compare that to your IDIOT trump’s clown show of lies and nonsense.\n\nHow trump *SCREW UP &amp; FAILED* at every step with this Pandemic. Lives will be lost because of his incompetence.\n\n* STEALING PPE’s:* It is now being reported that trump’s administration is stealing orders of PPE’s. Orders are begin redirected by the WH and nobody know where they are going. Last week Germany and France reported that their orders were seized and redirected to the US. Nobody knows where these PPE’s are actually going. Trump early on accused NY doctors and nurses were stealing or hording PPE’s to cover up the fact that he failed to deliver on his promises for PPE’s. Now we know that he is behind the shortages making this worse.\n*US Accused of hijacking coronavirus supplies*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1sLA2wyWaI\n*US is accused of hijacking shipments of masks*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhKN4UTXFjQ \n*France Accuses US of Buying Up Chinese Masks Bound for France*\nhttps://youtu.be/OkPYm2lKlts\n \n* SCREW UP:* trump eviscerated the CDC budget in 2017\n* SCREW UP:* trump eliminated the Pandemic Emergency Response Team along with all the expertise on epidemics/pandemics in 2017\n* SCREW UP:* trump ended an early warning program just 2 months before the covid-19 started spreading is Wuhan, China. This would have saved millions of lives. \n* SCREW UP:* Trump was warned of this in December and again in January and instead of taking actions did less than nothing as all the screw up listed below. EVERYONE saw this coming except trump.\n* SCREW UP: Just the 4 things I’ve mentioned so far show an incredible lack of understanding and complete incompetence. He could not of done more harm than if it were intentional but his list of failures continue and there are many.\n* SCREW UP:* China notified WHO and the CDC that they identified the virus and released the genome sequence so that countries can make tests to detect the new virus. Trump the F’k Up did nothing.\n*SCREW UP:* Even after the Pandemic was clear trump cut the budget for the CDC and healthcare.\n* SCREW UP:* W.H.O. recommended a proven test kit but the CDC rejected it and decided to make their own and it failed to work. This was perhaps the biggest mistake of all. \n* SCREW UP:* trump didn&#39;t want people to be tested cause that would make the number of people infected go up.\n* SCREW UP:* trump down played the threat and discouraged early action that could have been take so we would have been better prepared.\n* SCREW UP:* trump has been lying to the public and giving bad advice. He continues to lie and mislead the public in all his press briefings.\n* SCREW UP:* He ordered a stand down in the face of a Pandemic demonstrating that he is too stupid to understand what we are up against.\n* SCREW UP:* trump to the public that anyone can go to a doctor or hospital to get tested. He lied, there were no test kits available. \n* SCREW UP:* Closing the boarder with China then with Europe was cosmetic move and useless without having any testing. Testing was and is the single most important tool in fighting this but trump didn’t want to do testing cause it might make the numbers go up.\n* SCREW UP:* according the statistical analysis over 95% of death from this pandemic will be directly the fault of trump and his destructive actions.\n* SCREW UP:* The great trump economy is a complete washout. It fell below January 2017 levels. Trump made the markets much worse because of his incompetence and gross mishandling of this crisis in every way imaginable.  \n* SCREW UP:* trump continues to lie to the public and promoting drugs that have not been tested for the coronavirus. As a result he has created a shortage of much needed drugs for other problems which can and will cause other people to die. \nhttps://youtu.be/2Yph4FqskDc\n*Doctor Calls Trump’s Claims Quackery and Dangerous*\n* SCREW UP:* trump continues to refuse to listen to medical advice on this pandemic. This is putting the public at greater danger. His recklessness is killing people.\n* SCREW UP* FEMA had a deal to make ventilators then the IDIOT trump put jared kushner in charge to then said no. Now the 80,000 ventilators wont be ready in time when we need them. \n* SCREW UP:* A vaccine funded by taxpayer money the CORRUPT trump gave a patient to a private company that will prevent people from getting it. \n* SCREW UP:* trump is giving medical advice that has not been proven to work. Dr. Fauci said prior it is not advisable to take such drugs that have not been tested. When asked at a WH Briefing trump would not let Dr. Fauci answer the question about the drugs trump is pushing.  The testing of Hydroxychloquine stopped due to creating heart problems in people. So, the IDIOT trump’s advice could kill people.\n* SCREW UP:* Continues to fail to deliver respirators as promised and has a temper tantrum and storms out of the press briefing when asked about the delays and then storms out of the press briefing. \n* SCREW UP: * After trump urges people to try Hydroxychloquine a man in Arizona tried it and died.  https://youtu.be/iSI5m5UbaQ4\n* SCREW UP:* trump continues to lie about testing and respirators.\n* LIES by trump’s own mouth:* https://youtu.be/kKD25397CZQ\n*SCREW UP:* On April 14 trump brasenily used the corona press briefing to show a propaganda video filled with disinformation (LIES) to promote himself. Considering how how he as screwed up every way possible he has to resort to propaganda videos.\n* SCREW UP:* there will still be trump turds that will defend their dear lead to the bitter end and that is proof of just how stupid they are. They also hate this country. They are delighting in seeing the US’s destruction and the thousands of deaths because of trump’s incompetence and stupidity.\n\nThe “great trump economy” *As of April 9, 2020 over 16 Million people filed for unemployment*\n\n*Global Health Expert: Testing Fundamental To Beating COVID-19*\nhttps://youtu.be/RQT-0k9CerM\n\n*How the Government Botched the Coronavirus Response (LegalEagle’s Real Law Review)*\nhttps://youtu.be/r4EVn03aCJg\n\n*How the U.S. botched its COVID-19 response*\nhttps://youtu.be/JYW7PhIGNfw\n\nDr. Mike Hansen: US did nothing for over 2 months (Reported Mar 16, 2020)\n*COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Who Should Get Tested?*\nhttps://youtu.be/P2hXnt9xrvY\n\nMarch 28, 2020 CDC Dr Anthony Fauci said there can be as many as 100,000 to 200,000 dead.

Everything is going wrong, 10’s of thousand will die because of trump and the great trump economy is worse than the 2008 crash.

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;People compare South Korea, but it&amp;#39;s a different culture, size etc but now there IS a direct comparison available to show what America would look like with competent management, in the form of Australia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia has 2 million Chinese students (American has 360,000) Australia is closer to Asia, with more travel overall, both countries got their first case in the same week, both are developed world, western ideology countries with no mask wearing culture, fierce defence of human rights &amp;amp; freedoms, both have right wing/conservative governments, both have primarily off shore manufacture of all PPE, ventilators, test kits etc, both have a history of strong medical inventions &amp;amp; research (American much more money invested though). Australia&amp;#39;s population is 10 times lower BUT it is concentrated on the coast, with 2 cities of over 5 million people. Both countries have around the same land mass &amp;amp; produce enough food for all their population &amp;amp; significant amounts of the world outside their country. Both have sweet, lovable, smaller, more left leaning neighbours (Canada &amp;amp; New Zealand), along with a neighbour with far less stability &amp;amp; advanced technology (Mexico &amp;amp; Indonesia)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all round we really couldn&amp;#39;t get a closer comparison for a scenario like this virus if we tried!&lt;br /&gt;So how do they compare?&lt;br /&gt;America you all know the details on&lt;br /&gt;Australia, 6,494 cases, 61 deaths &amp;amp; over half of those cases now recovered. New cases in Australia have been under 100 each day for 3 days now, after a steady decline for 2 weeks since the &amp;quot;stay at home where possible&amp;quot; directions were given &amp;amp; the peak is believed to have passed. That&amp;#39;s what America would look like under competent management!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia is now using the time it&amp;#39;s bought to ramp up local production of ventilators &amp;amp; PPE (as well as ongoing overseas acquisitions), as well as training nurses in intensive care management &amp;amp; making sure it&amp;#39;s fully resourced to handle any surge in cases, along with making sure there&amp;#39;s the resources to make more test kits &amp;amp; carry out unlimited testing in any area that might see a local outbreak. Once that&amp;#39;s done, it will &amp;quot;take the brake off&amp;quot; &amp;amp; begin reducing restrictions, but not before. There is certainly no talk of reducing restrictions in Australia yet! The restrictions put in place were designed to be sustainable long term &amp;amp; everyone was told to expect them to be in place for 6 months, so anything less than 6 months of stay at home directions will be seen as a bonus, not an expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is Australia managing to control it?&lt;br /&gt;1. health workers at airports very early on in the virus, giving symptom information &amp;amp; contact details in case of symptoms to all travelers from China (as well as just a friendly chat to make them feel comfortable in coming forward if they got sick. We caught &amp;amp; isolated every single case from Wuhan without any community transmission)&lt;br /&gt;2. free health care for covid-19 symptoms for ANYONE with them, regardless of citizenship or normal health care coverage status&lt;br /&gt;3. contact tracing for every positive test &amp;amp; every person identified to have been in face to face contact with an infected person for 15 minutes, or in the same room as the person for 2 hours is put into mandatory quarantine in their home (other than this the &amp;quot;stay at home&amp;quot; is advice rather than mandatory). Facilities have been set up to allow homeless people &amp;amp; tourists to have access to hotel rooms for this quarantine if required&lt;br /&gt;4. closing of borders, similar timeline to America on this, but full global ban on travel now. Citizens can still return home, but are taken by police/army into quarantine hotels (which are paid for by the government, but by doing this, it keeps those hotel staff employed too, so most 5 star hotels have jumped at the chance to become a quarantine hotel)&lt;br /&gt;6. good use of available in country resources &amp;amp; in particular the military, everything from sending engineers into surgical mask making facilities to see if there&amp;#39;s anything they can do to assist the company ramp up production to cataloging &amp;amp; servicing veterinary ventilators for use on humans if needed, to transporting medical personnel around the country, to replacing all staff at 3 hospitals, due to an outbreak in those hospitals &amp;amp; the need to put all staff into quarantine to figure out who was &amp;amp; wasn&amp;#39;t infected. To be clear, Australia&amp;#39;s military is MUCH smaller than America&amp;#39;s, so if we can do this, not sure why America isn&amp;#39;t doing this on a much wider scale, even having military people working in teams to manually ventilate people there&amp;#39;s not enough mechanical ventilators for.&lt;br /&gt;7. restricting movement of people by requesting everyone stay at home if not needing to go out to work, education, &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; shopping, care &amp;amp; compassion needs &amp;amp; exercise . In order to support that &amp;amp; actually make it happen, the government is paying everyone who can&amp;#39;t work $750 per week, along with guaranteeing no evictions from inability to pay rent, no disconnect of electricity, internet or other essential services &amp;amp; in most cases the workers are still connected to their employers in getting those payments &amp;amp; so have the mental health of knowing they have a job to return to in 6 months time. &amp;quot;Essential&amp;quot; shopping includes the purchase of anything that will make staying at home more comfortable, the PM used the example of his wife buying &amp;quot;a pile of jigsaws&amp;quot; to explain what constituted &amp;quot;essential shopping&amp;quot;. Result of all of this is over 90% of the population have voluntarily stayed home the majority of the time (while toy &amp;amp; hobby stores &amp;amp; hardware stores are needing to really increase their &amp;quot;social distancing&amp;quot; policies &amp;amp; have had people queuing for hours to enter). The government were REALLY hoping to reach 80% compliance, the 90% compliance has crashed the case numbers!&lt;br /&gt;8. maintaining open schools &amp;amp; childcare centres for anyone who needs them, with free childcare for all who want it, but parents encouraged to keep their kids at home with online classes if possible&lt;br /&gt;9. extensive support for all vulnerable people. Nursing homes are locked down with few to no physical visitors allowed, those in the community still have access to regular support services, with effectively unlimited funds now available if needed. That means meals on wheels are delivering toiletpaper &amp;amp; other household essentials as well as meals, elderly &amp;amp; disabled people (and those in mandatory quarantine) can access online priority deliveries or personal shoppers to help them, home library services are still operating, anyone under 65 with a disability was already on a disability program called NDIS that gave them access to community supports, these have now been extensively enhanced, with automatic approvals of additional funding &amp;amp; services for anything needed due to the virus &amp;amp; automatic renewals of annual plans for a 2 year period to remove the need to leave the home for any sort of red tape around funding &amp;amp; all welfare recipients &amp;amp; over 65&amp;#39;s got a one off $750 payment to cover any extra, unexpected costs too&lt;br /&gt;10. testing, testing &amp;amp; more testing. Initially testing travelers &amp;amp; contacts of travelers with symptoms, restricted for everyone else, due to limits in availability of tests, now testing random samples &amp;amp; setting up mobile &amp;amp; drive through clinics in any suburb with clusters to test every person with any symptoms that could be the virus. There is a fear that there could be unknown community spread, so everything possible is being done to search for any signs of that &amp;amp; eliminate if found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia has screwed up too, in particular with the &amp;quot;Ruby Princess&amp;quot; a cruise ship that to date has caused over 700 cases, after the 3000+ people were disembarked into the middle of a city of 5 million people, despite dozens of them having symptoms at the time of disembarking! 2 days later the test results were confirmed &amp;amp; alerts were sent out that those people who had left the ship &amp;amp; gone home to their families may be in the incubation period for the virus! At least one hire car driver who transported one of those passengers home has since ended up in hospital with the virus! Many of those people also boarded domestic flights &amp;amp; traveled to every state in Australia before they knew they were infected. Total screw up, that the various governments &amp;amp; government agencies are still fighting over who is to blame for. Most of Australia&amp;#39;s virus deaths are from the elderly population that was on board that cruise ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing Australia has done that America couldn&amp;#39;t have done too! Australia shows what should have happened in America &amp;amp; what would have happened with competent leadership! It also shows that stay at home orders work, BUT that it is NOT time to reduce/remove them in the US yet! If even a country with cases as low as Australia (and New Zealand) aren&amp;#39;t considering removing them, then clearly it&amp;#39;s dumb for the US to think they&amp;#39;re ready to!&quot;,
                        &quot;textOriginal&quot;: &quot;People compare South Korea, but it&#39;s a different culture, size etc but now there IS a direct comparison available to show what America would look like with competent management, in the form of Australia. \n\nAustralia has 2 million Chinese students (American has 360,000) Australia is closer to Asia, with more travel overall, both countries got their first case in the same week, both are developed world, western ideology countries with no mask wearing culture, fierce defence of human rights &amp; freedoms, both have right wing/conservative governments, both have primarily off shore manufacture of all PPE, ventilators, test kits etc, both have a history of strong medical inventions &amp; research (American much more money invested though).

The restrictions put in place were designed to be sustainable long term &amp; everyone was told to expect them to be in place for 6 months, so anything less than 6 months of stay at home directions will be seen as a bonus, not an expectation.\n\n\nHow is Australia managing to control it?\n1. health workers at airports very early on in the virus, giving symptom information &amp; contact details in case of symptoms to all travelers from China (as well as just a friendly chat to make them feel comfortable in coming forward if they got sick. We caught &amp; isolated every single case from Wuhan without any community transmission)\n2. free health care for covid-19 symptoms for ANYONE with them, regardless of citizenship or normal health care coverage status\n3. contact tracing for every positive test &amp; every person identified to have been in face to face contact with an infected person for 15 minutes, or in the same room as the person for 2 hours is put into mandatory quarantine in their home (other than this the \&quot;stay at home\&quot; is advice rather than mandatory). Facilities have been set up to allow homeless people &amp; tourists to have access to hotel rooms for this quarantine if required\n4. closing of borders, similar timeline to America on this, but full global ban on travel now. Citizens can still return home, but are taken by police/army into quarantine hotels (which are paid for by the government, but by doing this, it keeps those hotel staff employed too, so most 5 star hotels have jumped at the chance to become a quarantine hotel)\n6. good use of available in country resources &amp; in particular the military, everything from sending engineers into surgical mask making facilities to see if there&#39;s anything they can do to assist the company ramp up production to cataloging &amp; servicing veterinary ventilators for use on humans if needed, to transporting medical personnel around the country, to replacing all staff at 3 hospitals, due to an outbreak in those hospitals &amp; the need to put all staff into quarantine to figure out who was &amp; wasn&#39;t infected. To be clear, Australia&#39;s military is MUCH smaller than America&#39;s, so if we can do this, not sure why America isn&#39;t doing this on a much wider scale, even having military people working in teams to manually ventilate people there&#39;s not enough mechanical ventilators for.\n7. restricting movement of people by requesting everyone stay at home if not needing to go out to work, education, \&quot;essential\&quot; shopping, care &amp; compassion needs &amp; exercise . In order to support that &amp; actually make it happen, the government is paying everyone who can&#39;t work $750 per week, along with guaranteeing no evictions from inability to pay rent, no disconnect of electricity, internet or other essential services &amp; in most cases the workers are still connected to their employers in getting those payments &amp; so have the mental health of knowing they have a job to return to in 6 months time. \&quot;Essential\&quot; shopping includes the purchase of anything that will make staying at home more comfortable, the PM used the example of his wife buying \&quot;a pile of jigsaws\&quot; to explain what constituted \&quot;essential shopping\&quot;. Result of all of this is over 90% of the population have voluntarily stayed home the majority of the time (while toy &amp; hobby stores &amp; hardware stores are needing to really increase their \&quot;social distancing\&quot; policies &amp; have had people queuing for hours to enter). The government were REALLY hoping to reach 80% compliance, the 90% compliance has crashed the case numbers!\n8. maintaining open schools &amp; childcare centres for anyone who needs them, with free childcare for all who want it, but parents encouraged to keep their kids at home with online classes if possible\n9. extensive support for all vulnerable people. Nursing homes are locked down with few to no physical visitors allowed, those in the community still have access to regular support services, with effectively unlimited funds now available if needed. That means meals on wheels are delivering toiletpaper &amp; other household essentials as well as meals, elderly &amp; disabled people (and those in mandatory quarantine) can access online priority deliveries or personal shoppers to help them, home library services are still operating, anyone under 65 with a disability was already on a disability program called NDIS that gave them access to community supports, these have now been extensively enhanced, with automatic approvals of additional funding &amp; services for anything needed due to the virus &amp; automatic renewals of annual plans for a 2 year period to remove the need to leave the home for any sort of red tape around funding &amp; all welfare recipients &amp; over 65&#39;s got a one off $750 payment to cover any extra, unexpected costs too\n10. testing, testing &amp; more testing. Initially testing travelers &amp; contacts of travelers with symptoms, restricted for everyone else, due to limits in availability of tests, now testing random samples &amp; setting up mobile &amp; drive through clinics in any suburb with clusters to test every person with any symptoms that could be the virus. There is a fear that there could be unknown community spread, so everything possible is being done to search for any signs of that &amp; eliminate if found.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has screwed up too, in particular with the \&quot;Ruby Princess\&quot; a cruise ship that to date has caused over 700 cases, after the 3000+ people were disembarked into the middle of a city of 5 million people, despite dozens of them having symptoms at the time of disembarking! 2 days later the test results were confirmed &amp; alerts were sent out that those people who had left the ship &amp; gone home to their families may be in the incubation period for the virus! At least one hire car driver who transported one of those passengers home has since ended up in hospital with the virus! Many of those people also boarded domestic flights &amp; traveled to every state in Australia before they knew they were infected. Total screw up, that the various governments &amp; government agencies are still fighting over who is to blame for. Most of Australia&#39;s virus deaths are from the elderly population that was on board that cruise ship.\n\n\nThere&#39;s nothing Australia has done that America couldn&#39;t have done too! Australia shows what should have happened in America &amp; what would have happened with competent leadership! It also shows that stay at home orders work, BUT that it is NOT time to reduce/remove them in the US yet! If even a country with cases as low as Australia (and New Zealand) aren&#39;t considering removing them, then clearly it&#39;s dumb for the US to think they&#39;re ready to!&quot;,

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;We need to stop virus transmission with masks and touch hygiene but this should not be accomplished by exacerbating the infection of victims if at all possible. New types of fiber filter masks and HAZMAT Level B respirator masks must be designed and manufactured to prevent infected people from transmitting the virus to others without forcing the repeated inhalation of the virus from the mask. The N95 respirator mask with a valve, although very effective in preventing infection, does not filter the exhausted breath so it does not prevent transmission if you become infected. Moreover, both the N95 and surgical masks will trap the virus so that viral droplets are re-inhaled into the lungs of the victim where it could exponentially increase the viral load and severity of the infection yielding higher mortality rates. The N95 valve helps limit virus accumulation inside the mask so it should be altered to exhaust the contaminated breath into a filter “pillow” attached to the outside of the exhaust valve to capture the virus away from the inhalation portion of the mask. The exhaust filter can further protect the N95 filter from projectile droplets and reduce the potential for transmission to others or back to one’s own lungs. In the short term, you could add a surgical mask on top of your N95 valve or even add two cloth masks with a hole in the first one to allow breath vented from the valve to be trapped between the two surgical masks. Once you know you’re infected any fiber mask should be replaced regularly to reduce viral load available for inhalation. The better, and likely cheaper option in the long run, is the use of a true HAZMAT Level B full or half face respirator mask that has a disinfecting filter cartridge added over the exhaust valve to prevent viral transmission from the wearer. These masks have much better virus exclusion due to the silicone seal and use long lasting filter cartridges that are more effective than fiber masks and are safer to handle and dispose once contaminated. If a barbed hose bib were added to these masks, it would allow external attachment of an oxygen supply tube. Removal of an inflow filter cartridge would allow attachment of a ventilator hose. An everyman PPE kit should be composed of: two modified N95s w/exhaust filter, eye protection, gloves infused with antiviral solution, and a 2 oz. nebulizer with the antiviral solution to refresh the gloves. This kit would cost &amp;lt;$10 and wide distribution might be able to reduce the transmission rate sufficiently to eliminate the viral reservoir in the population. The Level B respirator modification is necessary to reduce the mortality rate in patients and to allow the medical staff to continue working safely, even if they get infected and are asymptomatic. I’m not a medical professional so please validate these suggestions with your respiratory therapist, especially if you succumb.&quot;,

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;We need to stop virus transmission with masks and touch hygiene but this should not be accomplished by exacerbating the infection of victims if at all possible. New types of fiber filter masks and HAZMAT Level B respirator masks must be designed and manufactured to prevent infected people from transmitting the virus to others without forcing the repeated inhalation of the virus from the mask. The N95 respirator mask with a valve, although very effective in preventing infection, does not filter the exhausted breath so it does not prevent transmission if you become infected. Moreover, both the N95 and surgical masks will trap the virus so that viral droplets are re-inhaled into the lungs of the victim where it could exponentially increase the viral load and severity of the infection yielding higher mortality rates. The N95 valve helps limit virus accumulation inside the mask so it should be altered to exhaust the contaminated breath into a filter “pillow” attached to the outside of the exhaust valve to capture the virus away from the inhalation portion of the mask. The exhaust filter can further protect the N95 filter from projectile droplets and reduce the potential for transmission to others or back to one’s own lungs. In the short term, you could add a surgical mask on top of your N95 valve or even add two cloth masks with a hole in the first one to allow breath vented from the valve to be trapped between the two surgical masks. Once you know you’re infected any fiber mask should be replaced regularly to reduce viral load available for inhalation. The better, and likely cheaper option in the long run, is the use of a true HAZMAT Level B full or half face respirator mask that has a disinfecting filter cartridge added over the exhaust valve to prevent viral transmission from the wearer. These masks have much better virus exclusion due to the silicone seal and use long lasting filter cartridges that are more effective than fiber masks and are safer to handle and dispose once contaminated. If a barbed hose bib were added to these masks, it would allow external attachment of an oxygen supply tube. Removal of an inflow filter cartridge would allow attachment of a ventilator hose. An everyman PPE kit should be composed of: two modified N95s w/exhaust filter, eye protection, gloves infused with antiviral solution, and a 2 oz. nebulizer with the antiviral solution to refresh the gloves. This kit would cost &amp;lt;$10 and wide distribution might be able to reduce the transmission rate sufficiently to eliminate the viral reservoir in the population. The Level B respirator modification is necessary to reduce the mortality rate in patients and to allow the medical staff to continue working safely, even if they get infected and are asymptomatic. I’m not a medical professional so please validate these suggestions with your respiratory therapist, especially if you succumb.&quot;,
