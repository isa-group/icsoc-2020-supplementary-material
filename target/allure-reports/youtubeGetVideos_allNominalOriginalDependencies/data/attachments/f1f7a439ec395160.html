                &quot;description&quot;: &quot;On Easter Sunday (April 12, 2020), by invitation of the City and of the Duomo cathedral of Milan, Italian global music icon Andrea Bocelli gave a solo performance representing a message of love, healing and hope to Italy and the world. \n\nDownload the hymn sheet and sing along here: https://AndreaBocelli.lnk.to/Hymnsheet\n\nTrack list:\nPanis Angelicus (from “Messe Solennelle” Op. 12, FWV 61) César Franck\n \nAve Maria, CG 89a (arr. from Johann Sebastian Bach, “Prelude” no. 1, BWV 846)\nCharles-François Gounod\n \nSancta Maria (arr. from “Cavalleria Rusticana”, Intermezzo)\nPietro Mascagni\n \nDomine Deus (from “Petite Messe Solennelle”)\nGioachino Antonio Rossini\n\nAmazing Grace\nJohn Newton\n\n“On the day in which we celebrate the trust in a life that triumphs, I’m honored and happy to answer ‘Sì’ to the invitation of the City and the Duomo of Milan. I believe in the strength of praying together; I believe in the Christian Easter, a universal symbol of rebirth that everyone – whether they are believers or not – truly needs right now. Thanks to music, streamed live, bringing together millions of clasped hands everywhere in the world, we will hug this wounded Earth’s pulsing heart, this wonderful international forge that is reason for Italian pride. The generous, courageous, proactive Milan and the whole of Italy will be again, and very soon, a winning model, engine of a renaissance that we all hope for. It will be a joy to witness it, in the Duomo, during the Easter celebration which evokes the mystery of birth and rebirth” Andrea Bocelli\n \nAndrea Bocelli, with the Foundation that carries his name, is currently involved in an emergency COVID-19 campaign. The Andrea Bocelli Foundation (ABF) has started a fundraiser to help hospitals purchase all the instrumentation and equipment necessary to protect their medical staff. It is possible to donate through the GoFundMe campaign: https://www.gofundme.com/f/wk67wc-abfxcamerino\n\nStay home and live stream this performance exclusively on YouTube.
