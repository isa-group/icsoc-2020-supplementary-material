                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;Let&#39;s remember that the \&quot;mark of the beast\&quot; represents the decision to follow the beast who opposes God and His laws. But who is the beast? Please ask God to give you light on this subject before continuing...\r\n\r\n----The beast is the same as the \&quot;little horn\&quot; described in Daniel 7:8. This little horn plucks up three of the other horns in order to set up his kingdom. This scene is describing a historical political event when the rulers of the earth were shifting power. The little horn represents Rome (more specifically, papal Rome) who overthrew the Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths. Rome completed this conquest in 538 A.D.\r\n\r\n---\&quot;And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.\&quot; Daniel 7:25. The beast power speaks against God, persecutes God&#39;s people, and changes the laws of God. Papal Rome claims to serve God but they speak contrary to the word of God (this is the reason the protestant faith was born - to protest the false doctrines of the catholic church). During the dark ages (538 A.D. - 1798 A.D.), the papacy was responsible for the persecution and execution of millions of Christians. The changing of \&quot;times and laws\&quot; refers to the changes made to the ten commandments of God. In 321 A.D., Constantine declared Sunday (pagan day of worshipping the sun) would replace the seventh-day Sabbath as the new day of rest for all Christians, but God did not authorize any man to change His holy laws. The Catholic church maintains the sacredness of Sunday to this day.\r\n\r\n----\&quot;Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\&quot; Revelation 13:18. \&quot;VICARIUS FILII DEI\&quot; are the Latin words found on the pope&#39;s crown. When you add these letters together using Latin numerals, the sum equals 666.\r\n\r\nSo what is the sign of allegiance to papal Rome? What is the sign of allegiance to God? \r\n\r\nThe mark of the beast will be received by all those who choose to worship on Sunday as opposed to the seventh-day Sabbath. It makes no difference which denomination you belong to. The simple matter at hand is this: will you choose to obey God rather than men?\r\n\r\nSome people argue that the mark of the beast is a micro chip. The micro chip is not the mark of the beast, however, it may play a very important role in forcing people to receive the mark of the beast. For example, the micro chip could be used as a tool to control the masses. We may hear such threats as \&quot;worship on Sunday with us or we will turn off your micro chip and you will not be able to &#39;buy or sell.&#39;\&quot; (Revelation 13:7)\r\n\r\nWe are told that there will be \&quot;wars, and rumours of wars,... and famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\&quot; (Matthew 24:6,7). As these calamities increase in scale and frequency, both politicians and the papacy will call upon the people to unite in solidarity in order to arrest the disasters and hatred which threatens the entire human race. How will people be asked to unite? By keeping Sunday as a day of rest. This proposal of Sunday rest is already found in the latest encyclical written by Pope Francis, and will be presented to world leaders for implementation in November 2017. \r\n\r\nSo what do we do? God instructs His people to keep His commandments (including the true seventh-day Sabbath). We are not to obey the laws of men over the laws of God. When it shall be declared BY LAW that Sunday is to be kept as a sacred day of rest, this is the time we are to \&quot;flee into the mountains.\&quot; \r\n\r\n----\&quot;When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains: Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day.\&quot; Matthew 24:15-20\r\n\r\nPlease brethren, let no man fool you. If aliens come but \&quot;speak not according to God&#39;s word,\&quot; they are deceivers. Do not believe them.\r\n\r\nIf your pastor tells you not to worry about this day or that day, they \&quot;speak not according to the word\&quot; and are deceivers. Do not believe them.\r\n\r\nIf a bright and glorious figure unlike anything you have ever seen in your life claims to be Jesus and preforms many miracles and many wonders, and even causes fire to rain down from heaven... but he \&quot;speaks not according to the word,\&quot; he is a deceiver. Do not believe him (besides, Jesus said He would return in the clouds... not walk upon the earth as He did the first time He came). \r\n\r\nSatan is going to try many things to cause us to receive the mark of the beast (allegiance to the papacy via Sunday worship) because he knows that all who receive the mark of the beast will receive the wrath of God and will suffer the last 7 plagues found in Revelation chapter 16. Also, those who receive the mark of the beast will partake in the second death, which is eternal death (see Revelation 14:9-11).\r\n\r\nProbation for mankind finally closes when we make the decision to worship the beast (Sunday), or God (seventh-day Sabbath). All must make this final decision before Jesus returns. Remember, it is not \&quot;thus saith tradition,\&quot; or \&quot;thus saith professor so-and-so,\&quot; or \&quot;thus saith pastor X,\&quot; or \&quot;thus saith my dead relatives...\&quot; it is THUS SAITH THE LORD. \r\n\r\nWho will you worship?&quot;,

                            &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;THE NEW WORLD ORDER &amp; THE MARK OF THE BEAST REVEALED!!!\n\nRevelation 14:9-14,  \&quot;And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\&quot;\n\nThe\&quot;Mark of the Beast\&quot; is about worship!!! Anyone who will not worship the beast/antichrist will be removed from economic participation and ultimately die when the \&quot;Mark\&quot; will be enforced.\n\nRevelation 13:16-18 -And he (Antichrist) causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.  \n\nThe widespread idea that the mark is visible is false. The computerchip is a hoax that has set up the world to receive the true mark.  Satan is wiser than man. A visible mark which the world has been taught, this would deceive no one. The mark is given to those who will continue to sin and transgress God&#39;s holy law, while the saints of God will receive His seal because they walked not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. They would refuse to yield up temptation to sin against God. \nThe works of true love will bring forth the works of the law, which will be established in the true Christian, which is the character that Christ is truly abiding. The old self will die which loved the life of sin and pleasure. The old man will be crucified and will become a new creature. Then they will truly be born again. Repentance has always be the message to the world after the fall of Adam and Eve. \n\nIn Bible prophecy the forehead represents our mind where we make the free will choice to serve God in obedience to His law or to serve Satan in sin, which is transgression of that law.  1John 3:4.\n In Bible prophecy the hand represents us being forced against our will or being led captive for not obeying. So if we do not worship the beast and his image by choosing to disobey and serve God,  the Antichrist will then try and force us against our will to worship him or have no ability to buy and sell. Then they will behead (Revelation 20:4) all who would not bow to this false worship system, which is being set up as we speak by the Antichrist. The world is being groomed already to receive the mark of the beast and thus,  refuse to receive the seal of God. If we are being sealed by the Holy Spirit,  we will have corresponding works of the law that Jesus is writing in the mind and heart of the true believer. \n\nSo. What is the mark of the beast/antichrist?\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church says:\n\n\&quot;Sunday is our &#39;MARK&#39; or authority. . .the church is above the Bible, and this transference of Sabbath observance is proof of that fact\&quot; Catholic Record of London, Ontario Sept 1,1923.\n\nThe Mark of the Beast—When Sunday observance shall be enforced by law, and the world shall be enlightened concerning the obligation of the true Sabbath, then whoever shall transgress the command of God, to obey a precept which has no higher authority than that of Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. He is paying homage to Rome, and to the power which enforces the institution ordained by Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his image. As men then reject the institution which God has declared to be the sign of His authority, and honor in its stead that which Rome has chosen as the token of her supremacy, they will thereby accept the sign of allegiance to Rome,—“the mark of the beast.” And it is not until the issue is thus plainly set before the people, and they are brought to choose between the commandments of God and the commandments of men, that those who continue in transgression will receive “the mark of the beast.” Revelation 14: 9-12.\n\n\&quot;The Bible says, Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. The Catholic church says, No! By my divine power I abolish the Sabbath day, and command you to keep the first day of the week. And lo, the entire civilized world bows down in reverent obedience to the command of the holy Catholic church!\&quot; Father Enright, C.S.S.R. of the RedemptoralCollege, Kansas City, History of the Sabbath, p. 802\n\nNo one has yet received the mark of the beast. The testing time has not yet come. There are true Christians in every church, not excepting the Roman Catholic communion. None are condemned until they have had the light and have seen the obligation of the fourth commandment. But when the decree shall go forth enforcing the counterfeit sabbath, and the loud cry of the third angel shall warn men against the worship of the beast and his image, the line will be clearly drawn between the false and the true. Then those who still continue in transgression will receive the mark of the beast.\n\nWhen Seal of God Is Refused—If the light of truth has been presented to you, revealing the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and showing that there is no foundation in the Word of God for Sunday observance, and yet you still cling to the false sabbath, refusing to keep holy the Sabbath which God calls “My holy day,” you receive the mark of the beast. When does this take place? When you obey the decree that commands you to cease from labor on Sunday and worship God, while you know that there is not a word in the Bible showing Sunday to be other than a common working day, you consent to receive the mark of the beast, and refuse the seal of God.\n\nAs a Result of Disregard of Light—God has given men the Sabbath as a sign between Him and them, as a test of their loyalty. Those who, after the light regarding God’s law comes to them, continue to disobey and exalt human laws above the law of God in the great crisis before us will receive the \&quot;mark of the beast\&quot;.\n\nThe Sunday...is purely a creation of the Catholic Church.\&quot; American Catholic Quarterly Review, January 1883\n\n\&quot;Sunday...It is the law of the Catholic Church alone...\&quot; American Sentinel (Catholic) June 1893\n\n\&quot;The Catholic church,\&quot; declared Cardinal Gibbons, \&quot;by virtue of her divine mission changed the day from Saturday to Sunday.\&quot; Catholic Mirror Sept. 23 1983.
