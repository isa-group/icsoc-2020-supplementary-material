                            &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;@Edward The Booble I learned that the terms “agnostic” and “agnosticism” were famously coined in the late nineteenth century by the English biologist, T.H. Huxley. He said that he originally invented the word “Agnostic” to denote people who, like [himself], confess themselves to be hopelessly ignorant concerning a variety of matters, about which metaphysicians and theologians, both orthodox and heterodox, dogmatise with the utmost confidence. (1884)\n\nincluding of course the matter of God’s existence. He did not, however, define “agnosticism” simply as the state of being an agnostic. Instead, he often used that term to refer to a normative epistemological principle, something similar to (though weaker than) what we now call “evidentialism”. Roughly, Huxley’s principle says that it is wrong to say that one knows or believes that a proposition is true without logically satisfactory evidence (Huxley 1884 and 1889). But it was Huxley’s application of this principle to theistic and atheistic belief that ultimately had the greatest influence on the meaning of the term. He argued that, since neither of those beliefs is adequately supported by evidence, we ought to suspend judgment on the issue of whether or not there is a God.\nNowadays, the term “agnostic” is often used (when the issue is God’s existence) to refer to those who follow the recommendation expressed in the conclusion of Huxley’s argument: an agnostic is a person who has entertained the proposition that there is a God but believes neither that it is true nor that it is false. Not surprisingly, then, the term “agnosticism” is often defined, both in and outside of philosophy, not as a principle or any other sort of proposition but instead as the psychological state of being an agnostic. Call this the “psychological” sense of the term. It is certainly useful to have a term to refer to people who are neither theists nor atheists, but philosophers might wish that some other term besides “agnostic” (“theological skeptic”, perhaps?) were used. The problem is that it is also very useful for philosophical purposes to have a name for the epistemological position that follows from the premise of Huxley’s argument, the position that neither theism nor atheism is known, or most ambitiously, that neither the belief that God exists nor the belief that God does not exist has positive epistemic status of any sort. Just as the metaphysical question of God’s existence is central to philosophy of religion, so too is the epistemological question of whether or not theism or atheism is known or has some other sort of positive epistemic status. And given the etymology of “agnostic”, what better term could there be for a negative answer to that epistemological question than “agnosticism”? Further, as suggested earlier, it is, for very good reason, typical in philosophy to use the suffix “-ism” to refer to a proposition instead of to a state or condition, since only the former can sensibly be tested by argument.\nIf, however, “agnosticism” is defined as a proposition, then “agnostic” must be defined in terms of “agnosticism” instead of the other way around. Specifically, “agnostic” must be defined as a person who believes that the proposition “agnosticism” is true instead of “agnosticism” being defined as the state of being an agnostic. And if the proposition in question is that neither theism nor atheism is known to be true, then the term “agnostic” can no longer serve as a label for those who are neither theists nor atheists since one can consistently believe that atheism (or theism) is true while denying that atheism (or theism) is known to be true.\nWhen used in this epistemological sense, the term “agnosticism” can very naturally be extended beyond the issue of what is or can be known to cover a large family of positions, depending on what sort of “positive epistemic status” is at issue. For example, it might be identified with any of the following positions: that neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief is justified, that neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief is rationally required, that neither belief is rationally permissible, that neither has warrant, that neither is reasonable, or that neither is probable. Also, in order to avoid the vexed issue of the nature of knowledge, one can simply distinguish as distinct members of the “agnosticism family” each of the following claims about intellectually sophisticated people: (i) neither theism nor atheism is adequately supported by the internal states of such people, (ii) neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief coheres with the rest of their beliefs, (iii) neither theistic nor atheistic belief results from reliable belief-producing processes, (iv) neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief results from faculties aimed at truth that are functioning properly in an appropriate environment, and so on.\nNotice too that, even if agnosticism were defined as the rather extreme position that neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief ever has positive epistemic status of any sort, it wouldn’t follow by definition that no agnostic is either a theist or an atheist. Some fideists, for example, believe that neither atheistic belief nor theistic belief is supported or sanctioned in any way at all by reason because reason leaves the matter of God’s existence completely unresolved. Yet they have faith that God exists and such faith (at least in some cases) involves belief. Thus, some fideists are extreme agnostics in the epistemological sense even though they are not agnostics in the psychological sense.\nIt is also worth mentioning that, even in Huxley’s time, some apophatic theists embraced the term “agnostic”, claiming that all good Christians worshipped an “unknown God”. More recently, some atheists proudly call themselves “agnostic atheists”, although with further reflection the symmetry between this position and fideism might give them pause. More likely, though, what is being claimed by these self-identified agnostic atheists is that, while their belief that God does not exist has positive epistemic status of some sort (minimally, it is not irrational), it does not have the sort of positive epistemic status that can turn true belief into knowledge.\nNo doubt both senses of “agnosticism”, the psychological and the epistemological, will continue to be used both inside and outside of philosophy. Hopefully, context will help to disambiguate. In the remainder of this entry, however, the term “agnosticism” will be used in its epistemological sense. This makes a huge difference to the issue of justification. Consider, for example, this passage written by the agnostic, Anthony Kenny (1983: 84–85):\n\nI do not myself know of any argument for the existence of God which I find convincing; in all of them I think I can find flaws. Equally, I do not know of any argument against the existence of God which is totally convincing; in the arguments I know against the existence of God I can equally find flaws. So that my own position on the existence of God is agnostic.\n\nIt is one thing to ask whether Kenny’s inability to find arguments that convince him of God’s existence or non-existence justifies him personally in suspending judgment about the existence of God. It is quite another to ask whether this inability (or anything else) would justify his believing that no one (or at least no one who is sufficiently intelligent and well-informed) has a justified belief about God’s existence.\nIf agnosticism (in one sense of the word) is the position that neither theism nor atheism is known, then it might be useful to use the term “gnosticism” to refer to the contradictory of that position, that is, to the position that either theism or atheism is known. That view would, of course, come in two flavors: theistic gnosticism—the view that theism is known (and hence atheism is not)—and atheistic gnosticism—the view that atheism is known (and hence theism is not).&quot;,

How to determine if it was a decision or negligence or misfortune? Should they be treated differently? Should bad choices not come with consequences?\n\nSuffering is at the bottom of all existence.  That’s just s fact. \nOnly effort, aka work, pushes back against that. People that willingly choose to not put in The effort do not deserve the help. And it’s not anyone’s responsibility to put in the effort for them otherwise.\n\nWe have a system that fully allows people to make something of themselves should they choose.  Anyone from any background can pursue and achieve success in this country. That’s not normal. But it comes with a flip side.  If you choose to not put in any effort you are likely to suffer. But at least you have the option and it’s on you.   \n\nFamily is so important, and it’s not taken seriously anymore.  You’re your family’s responsibility more than you are mine.  Fathers need to be around, and sticking around is not all on them(although a lot of it is)women also gotta not chase them off with too much nagging and bitching.\n\nCharity should be a willing choice, not forced on others.  \nif you wanna help people, good for you, have at it.

Many people don’t know that.

I assume you would have voted for HC. Meaning you&#39;re a hypocrite AND you&#39;re tied to a particular political party probably from a familial impression when you were younger.\n\nBut...fair play for the long comment, must have spent a lot of time on it. It&#39;s too bad that most of it just isn&#39;t true, can you provide evidence proving the trump campaign applied pressure on Israel? \n\nAt the end of the day, we&#39;re all humans getting by. And like it or not, trump is a human just like you. Not this monster you&#39;ve built up in your own subconscious.&quot;,
                            &quot;textOriginal&quot;: &quot;Dude, I&#39;ll pick one of these...\n22 women who accused him of sexual assault.\nYou got any evidence for that number or is this something you heard?\nBut if this is such an issue to you, are you not embarrassed that Bill Clinton settled 5 rape cases in court? I assume you would have voted for HC. Meaning you&#39;re a hypocrite AND you&#39;re tied to a particular political party probably from a familial impression when you were younger.\n\nBut...fair play for the long comment, must have spent a lot of time on it.

This is a fix for the awkward era where the dancing emoji was a sexy tango dancing senorita on iphone and a disco dancer with a pornstache on android. Because many emojis are gender neutral, and because the consortium gets jelled at a lot, one of the possible qualifiers is gender neutral. This, in turn, has led to artists mocking up gender neutral versions of previously gendered emoji which then becomes the only part of the story the media reports on.\n\nGetting genderfluid emojis is just a matter of changing the qualifier whenever the gender changes. Not really something for the consortium to deal with, but take it up with your keyboard app.&quot;,

This is a fix for the awkward era where the dancing emoji was a sexy tango dancing senorita on iphone and a disco dancer with a pornstache on android. Because many emojis are gender neutral, and because the consortium gets jelled at a lot, one of the possible qualifiers is gender neutral. This, in turn, has led to artists mocking up gender neutral versions of previously gendered emoji which then becomes the only part of the story the media reports on.&quot;,

This is a fix for the awkward era where the dancing emoji was a sexy tango dancing senorita on iphone and a disco dancer with a pornstache on android. Because many emojis are gender neutral (can be used to represent any gender), and because the consortium gets jelled at a lot, one of the possible qualifiers is gender neutral. This, in turn, has led to artists mocking up gender neutral versions of previously gendered emoji which then becomes the only part of the story the media reports on.&quot;,

It&#39;s not to say that&#39;s what a human life is worth, which I agree is not accountable, but rather an economical measure of people&#39;s quality of life. So it&#39;s that versus the economical effort the church has put into improving said quality of life. We can argue about measurement units, but in the end we&#39;ll need to use the same units for x and y to see if substracting them yields a negative or a positive.&quot;,

As for the tariffs against China, I agree with him China puts out inferior product. America is always put out quality products and since the Free Trade Agreement, which again was passed by Wild Bill Clinton who visited a pedophile Island 25 times and Hillary that gave our national secrets on her server and deleted it go figure. And you can say whatever you want Republicans and Democrats made money during the Iraq War, yes every politician made money during that war show to just blame President Bush is stupid. And to the present day Democrats wanted Trump to declare war on Iran for shooting down an unmanned spy plane what  it cost 20 billion dollars but to declare war for shooting a drone down, Trump said no I will not declare war on Iran for shooting a drone down! You may not be from China but are you antifa? America was founded on capitalism you do what you do to survive everything is not giving to, you do not rely on the government unlike communism where the government tells you what to do and give you some mediocre job, but you will never be able to live out your full potential but in America the sky&#39;s the limit. You are antifa aren&#39;t you!!&quot;,

That&#39;s like hating people for liking chocolate ice cream more than vanila. Playing these victim games is dumb. Also last time I checked a very small percentage (aka mostly paraders) of gays act hyper sexualized. The respectable majority I can applaud because they are civil therefore I feel them close even if they&#39;re gay. Degenerates last time I checked are defined as immoral people. Basically to reiterate I am refering to the small group of pride marchers who go nuts with sexual stunts. Immoral douches can be criticized and still be people. Duh! Still it&#39;s a person&#39;s choice to act the way they want.&quot;,

Of course they reversed back to their old ways of religious theocracy. Americans essentially forced them into it by being the lying murderous hypocrites they are.&quot;,

                            &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;Dillon Blair \n\nOut of your seat again, are you? Sigh... very well.\n\n1. If we’re going to be reading each others’ minutes back and forth, let me remind the court that you made no specific qualifiers regarding straight people being fired. You made a blanket statement that straight people can be fired for being straight, with no mention of the states where sexual orientation is protected.\n\nAnd along those lines you also said “sexuality isn’t a protected class” with no mention of the states where it is, demonstrating a lack of knowledge on the subject. If you’re going to get nit-picky, I see no reason why I shouldn’t return the favor, but it seems you did manage to check Google before you replied. Good on ya.\n\nAs to my initial statement regarding “when the number of states where you can be fired for being straight etc etc” the prosecution will concede the defense’s point and amend its original statement to say “when the number of people fired for being straight reaches the same number as those fired for being LGBT, THEN you can have a parade.”\n\n2. To follow up on that, again find me an example of a person being fired for being straight. It’s relevant because the entire reason sexual orientation has become a protected class in some states (not all, mind you, but less than half) is because the last several decades have demonstrated that it needs to be... and to stress this again, since apparently I need to, not because straight people need protection. They technically haven’t had it, true, but that’s because it wasn’t an issue until gays started getting fired.\n\nSo again... citation needed.\n\n2a. Objection: Putting words in my mouth. I never said I have the right to have someone hire me because I’m gay (a qualifier you failed to include, but I’m assuming you meant). I am saying both of us deserve the right to not be fired because of our sexual orientation (and since we’re being nit-picky, apparently, I will add that we ALL deserve that right, not just you and I). Again, as you pointed out, there are 29 states that disagree with that, and since the LGBT community is the one spearheading the campaign for that right... well, as we’re doing the bulk of the legwork yes, we deserve the parade more than you.\n\n3. As to your reiterated comments regarding mean words... sigh... again, it’s not just words. Sure, I can tune out Pat Robertson for the anti-gay bigot that he is (and do so regularly) but there’s two things to that: first, straight people don’t have to tune him out, at least not in the same way as he’s not talking about them. Just as white people don’t have to get invested in matters of racism against people of color and men don’t have to get invested in matters of misogyny, straight people don’t have the same at stake regarding anti-gay rhetoric because it’s no threat to them. In effect, they can afford to tune it out... or dismiss it as just “mean words.”\n\nThe second, and I argue more important, thing is that there are other people in this country who agree with him and his views and vote based on that. And run for office based on that. That’s where the “mean words” turn into that legislation you seem to be unaware of.\n\nWhat legislation have I/we endured, you ask? &lt;&lt;cracks knuckles&gt;&gt;\n\n- Try the Reagan administration actively silencing the CDC’s efforts to address and combat the AIDS epidemic in the 80’s, resulting in the deaths of thousands of (primarily gay) people due to lack of education and a delayed or non-existent response which allowed a new disease to turn into an epidemic.\n\n- Try the Bush administration pushing for a Constitutional amendment that explicitly defined marriage as between one man and one woman, effectively trying to block same-sex marriage in the text of the Constitution itself. True it didn’t pass, but the president of the United States himself was arguing to ban same-sex marriage. Just words? That time around, sure.\n\n- Try the fact that the Supreme Court only approved same-sex marriage nation-wide 4 years ago. Straight marriage has been legal since... always? Always, right? I’m gonna go with always.\n\n- Try the fact that Indiana passed the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, effectively making it legal for businesses to discriminate against LGBT people if it “violates their religious beliefs.”\n\n- For that matter, try the states which have introduced legislation allowing adoption agencies to refuse to adopt to LGBT parents on the grounds of “sincerely held religious beliefs.” Religious belief or not, discrimination is discrimination, and it’s a discrimination straight people do not ever have to endure.\n\nMe personally? I live in Illinois, which is thankfully one of the states in the union which is pretty good on LGBT protections.\n\nThere are plenty of states which are not.\n\nDoes my access to gay marriage prior to the Supreme Court’s intervention in 2015 negate the fact that there were people in other states who lacked it? Short answer: no.\n\nThose are the people I’m really advocating for here. I’m advocating for myself too, of course, but I guarantee you all of those states have LGBT populations whose rights are being restricted in ways that their straight counterparts are not solely based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.\n\nAnd finally, 3a. On the subject of dissenting opinions, when peoples’ opinions are uninformed, ignorant, and/or rooted in bigotry and seek to strip other people of their rights, rights which these people have always enjoyed because every citizen is supposed to have them, then it’s a little more serious than just a “dissenting opinion.” You are welcome to dissent all you want, sure, but don’t tell me to just accept it and get over it. I’m not arguing to dehumanize straight people or take their rights away; they can have a parade, I’m simply explaining the litany of reasons why they shouldn’t because they don’t need one.\n\nSo no, there is no comparison between why the LGBT community has pride parades and the straight community doesn’t.\n\nAnything else? I’ve got more, or are you ready to sit down and listen now?&quot;,

No, straight people can’t be fired for being straight in states where sexual orientation is a protected class, like Illinois, where I’m from, but not, for instance, in Alabama, where it is not. As such I will grant you that yes, people in those states CAN be fired for being straight. However, that leads me to...\n\n2. When has a straight person EVER been fired for being straight? When has a straight person ever even thought that they MIGHT be fired for being straight, whether in protected states or unprotected? I genuinely can’t wait to hear your answer. You’re citing a thing that never happens. I defy you to find me a legit instance where that has happened. I, on the other hand, can certainly cite you examples of gay people being fired or discriminated against for being gay.\n\nAnd thus...\n\n3. You’re technically right in that we don’t NEED a pride parade. Our survival as human beings doesn’t depend on having a pride parade...\n\n...but we DESERVE one.\n\nWe have listened to Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell blame us for 9/11, call us degenerates, vectors of disease, unfit to be parents, that our relationships are lesser than straight peoples’, but more importantly we have watched them campaign to strip our rights away from us because of those beliefs, to throw us in jail, deny us access to healthcare, even where we can and can’t shop, and people in Congress both listen to them and believe what they do.\n\nSo, “if you can’t handle mean words that’s on you” is grossly underselling why we deserve pride parades. We deserve them because not only do we endure mean words that you (I’m assuming) do not, but because we endure legislation and public actions that attempt to dehumanize us and make us lesser because of who we are.\n\nAnd, of course, all of this is besides the initial point of the above video, which you seem to be overlooking, namely: if the LGBT community doesn’t ‘need’ a pride parade, why does the straight community?\n\nTake a seat, bro. Your opinions on this matter will carry weight with me once they are better informed.&quot;,

My point is that if you want to say Colbert is a problem and should be shut down because he portrays himself as unbiased while pushing a certain narrative, then you should hold everyone to that same standard. Meaning if Colbert should be shut down, then all of those networks should be as well. In my opinion, we should shut down private news networks in favour of public news. The profit motive has poisoned how news is delivered to us because those networks will blow things out of proportion in order to get more of an audience which means more profit. Even if it&#39;s a blatant lie, they don&#39;t care as long as you tune in. The ebola crisis was a huge example. Most of the major news networks scared Americans into thinking it was a serious threat to the US, which of course made many Americans tune into their shows to see what&#39;s happening, which resulted in big profits for those networks. However if you looked at the BBC and their coverage of the ebola crisis, they said there was really no cause for alarm and that it likely wouldn&#39;t come to the UK. That&#39;s what honest journalism and news reporting looks like and we should demand this for ourselves rather than being complacent with the lies and propaganda spewed at us from the likes of Fox News, CNN, and all of the other mainstream news outlets.&quot;,

Not just stating the obvious but highlighting, as your reference shows, that they&#39;re an analog secondary to the mammalian reference point.  So it is linguistically and historically fitting to call them milks (almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk, etc.) but it&#39;s similar to the rubber pucks under stereo equipment being call \&quot;feet\&quot;.  I do see the term is dictionary-supported though, so thank you for the recalibration.&quot;,

We still see that today with the implementation of voter ID laws and other suppression techniques.\n\nPlus it&#39;s resulted in some weird shit like free, property owning, tax paying black men having their right to vote taken away by a few states in the early/mid-1800s (when apparently the governing bodies remembered they were composed almost entirely of racist pricks). I believe at least one state allowed white, property owning women allowed to vote for a period during the late 1700s to mid 1800s as well. Which wouldean all of two black business owners and six different wealthy white widows.\n\nAnd while poor white men were originally excluded from voting, we had near universal white male suffrage before the 15th was ratified. (Thougn I feel if you have to put that many qualifiers between \&quot;universal\&quot; and \&quot;suffrage\&quot; you should just drop the whole universal charade). So while the country as a whole decided that all white men deserve the vote, three or four northern states apparently thought that was just too many possible voters best get rid of even the potential a black or a woman might show up. Oh America. \n\nFun Fact: Asian immigrants should have been included under that whole \&quot;color or race\&quot; clause but that&#39;s a lot of outright racism to technically make illegal l at once, so to help us taper off   we just straight up denied them citizenship until like the 40s!&quot;,
