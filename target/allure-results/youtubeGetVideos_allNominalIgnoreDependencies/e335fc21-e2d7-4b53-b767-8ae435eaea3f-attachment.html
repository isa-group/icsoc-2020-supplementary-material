                &quot;description&quot;: &quot;down the stairs, barking from the inside. They must’ve figured that it was an emergency and they kicked down the door. \n\nMy dog led them to my room where they found me. The moment I saw the paramedic, I passed out. \n\nI only woke up in a hospital bed. I had no idea what time it was or where I was. “Hello, sleepy head!” said a voice. I couldn’t see clearly, I felt really dizzy and confused. “Where am I?” A sharp pain shot through my stomach. My face pulled as if I was eating a lemon. It was complete agony. \n\n“Shhh, Rest, sweetheart!” the voice said. I couldn’t really see what was going on, but I could feel a needle stuck in my arm. This stranger was touching my arm where the needle was, then it felt like she was injecting a fluid through the needle into my body. My eyes rolled, and I passed out again. \n\nIt was morning when I woke up from the sun shining on my face. My mind was more clear. I was laying alone in a hospital room. As I gazed around the room I was shocked to see a horrendous sight. My stomach! It was swollen like I had swallowed a huge pumpkin. \n\nDid I die and woke up as a pregnant lady? I lifted up the sheets, and saw that my stomach was the size of a hot air balloon. Tears started rolling down my face, I cried so loud that a nurse came running through the door. She was saying something, but I couldn’t hear. \nI was looking at my dad wearing a full on nurse outfit. He was pointing his fist at some guy. How the heck did my perfect dad end up doing all these bad stuff? Shockingly, the worst was yet to come. I yelled DAD. He looked up and I was surprised to see something I didn’t expect. \n\nHi, I’m Cheryl. Let me start from the beginning to give you a bit of a background story. This morning I woke up with a terrible stomach ache. I was in so much pain. It felt like a ball of thorns was stuck in my digestive system. It was so painful, that I couldn’t even get up or make a sound. \n\nI rolled over and fell out of bed onto my dog, who usually slept on the floor. He started whining. I couldn’t even rub his belly, to make him feel better. As I was laying on the floor, holding my stomach. My dog started barking. I knew no one was in the house to help me, I was alone. \n\nYou see, my mom disappeared when I was a young girl. Leaving my dad to raise me as a single parent. My dad is a truck driver and he usually leaves the house at 5:30am for his job. Since I only get up a few hours later, he doesn’t ever wake me up. Leaving me to get some beauty sleep. \n\nI was crouching on the floor while my dog was barking at me. I sometimes wonder if my dog is a little bit stupid, can’t he see that I’m suffering? I felt numb, it was so painful. I couldn’t even get up to grab my cellphone. At that moment I felt like passing out, maybe just closing my eyes and saying ‘hi’ to the angels. I mean what would you do? In a situation like that?\n\nTo my surprise, just as my stomach felt like it was going to rip out of my body. My dog stood on his hind legs, and used his nose to push my cellphone off of my bedside table. He pushed it towards my hand. Wow, he wasn’t so stupid after all. I could gather enough strength to call 911. \n\nThe operator was really helpful. She dispatched an ambulance and within a few minutes paramedics were at my home. I could hear them knocking on the door. My dog ran&quot;,

                &quot;description&quot;: &quot;TROLLS WORLD TOUR – In theaters and on demand April 10, 2020\n\nHow to Watch: www.watchtrolls.com\n\nAnna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake return in an all-star sequel to DreamWorks Animation’s 2016 musical hit: Trolls World Tour. In an adventure that will take them well beyond what they’ve known before, Poppy (Kendrick) and Branch (Timberlake) discover that they are but one of six different Troll tribes scattered over six different lands and devoted to six different kinds of music: Funk, Country, Techno, Classical, Pop and Rock. Their world is about to get a lot bigger and a whole lot louder.\n\nA member of hard-rock royalty, Queen Barb (Rachel Bloom), aided by her father King Thrash (Ozzy Osbourne), wants to destroy all other kinds of music to let rock reign supreme. With the fate of the world at stake, Poppy and Branch, along with their friends — Biggie (James Corden), Chenille (Caroline Hjelt), Satin (Aino Jawo), Cooper (Ron Funches) and Guy Diamond (Kunal Nayyar) — set out to visit all the other lands to unify the Trolls in harmony against Barb, who’s looking to upstage them all.\n\nCast as members of the different musical tribes is one the largest, and most acclaimed, groups of musical talent ever assembled for an animated film. From the land of Funk are Mary J. Blige, George Clinton and Anderson .Paak. Representing Country is Kelly Clarkson as Delta Dawn, with Sam Rockwell as Hickory and Flula Borg as Dickory. J Balvin brings Reggaeton, while Ester Dean adds to the Pop tribe. Anthony Ramos brings the beat in Techno and Jamie Dornan covers smooth jazz. World-renowned conductor and violinist Gustavo Dudamel appears as Trollzart and Charlyne Yi as Pennywhistle from the land of Classical. And Kenan Thompson raps as a hip-hop newborn Troll named Tiny Diamond.\n\nTrolls World Tour is directed by Walt Dohrn, who served as co-director on Trolls, and is produced by returning producer Gina Shay. The film is co-directed by David P. Smith and co-produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella, both of whom worked on the first Trolls. Trolls World Tour will also feature original music by Justin Timberlake, who earned an Oscar® nomination for his song for 2016’s Trolls, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!,” and a score by Theodore Shapiro (2016’s Ghostbusters, The Devil Wears Prada).\n\n\n\nJoin the fun on Peacock Kids where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more! \n\n→ Watch Something New! ← \nhttp://bit.ly/1L3zRrF\n\n\n→ SUBSCRIBE TO Peacock Kids! ← \nhttps://bit.ly/SubscribePeacockKids&quot;,
