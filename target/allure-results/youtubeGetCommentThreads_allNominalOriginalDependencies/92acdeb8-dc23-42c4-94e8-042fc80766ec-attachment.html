that 21 years old with developmental disability also a family that can reside but some of them violence and they can fall and die\n\nAmateo has asperber¬† or some kind of developmental problem plus he has seizures and¬†\n\nhis parents do not want him, but how peopel with seizures can drive for example or live independently¬†\n\nthat one time we could not make Amateo wake u when he parked and blocked a guest car he was sleeping for 4 hours\n\nuntil Rosie came to wake him up and he moved the car then\n\nRosie also blocking driveway with teal old Merecdes that doe snot drive if city offered a way for junky cars to be collected as well as installing solar there be so much fewer landlord and tenant disputes\n\nRosie rented me parking but when her family was visiting she was requesting i had to move my car for her family to block my car and it was creating disrutbabces she was always contacting me to do it now.¬†\n\nIt was pretty horrible.¬† When she broke into back yard it was her who installed the lock on back yard and then she lost key. She did not give me key to back yard. She then demanded key from me to back yard which she di not give me and then basically i had not realized she was going to brake into back yard and go there without key when I had my laundry drying. I do not know what she told me but police told me that I can reopen the case on Rosie for breaking the lock and going into back yard without working nd destroying my laundry with dust when i was not there. and all the harassment and hysterics.¬†\n\nI cant imagine like a person with the type of problems as her grandson and if she caused problems for him because she was left to baby sit. I need someone¬† mediate with her and it woudl also help a lot to define with her what i can and what repairs and inspections i am ok to order. The pest control was paid to come here regularly she told them to not come here canceled service when the rep was here. There is lot of harassment I woudl drop any claims if she allowed me to stay and continue to pay rent maybe you can tell her I have valid claims an that ell tp settle matters.\n\nThe most significant is proably Solar because even is doors remain to have wholes is solar energy not NG or Oil that s burned even for solar efficient use it woudl help the doors do not have giant holes. Insects all get in¬†\n\nvarious kind even a gekko once got in.\n\nRosie has violent personality and she one time chase gekko with shovel trying to kill it in my back yard.&quot;,

that 21 years old with developmental disability also a family that can reside but some of them violence and they can fall and die\n\nAmateo has asperber¬† or some kind of developmental problem plus he has seizures and¬†\n\nhis parents do not want him, but how peopel with seizures can drive for example or live independently¬†\n\nthat one time we could not make Amateo wake u when he parked and blocked a guest car he was sleeping for 4 hours\n\nuntil Rosie came to wake him up and he moved the car then\n\nRosie also blocking driveway with teal old Merecdes that doe snot drive if city offered a way for junky cars to be collected as well as installing solar there be so much fewer landlord and tenant disputes\n\nRosie rented me parking but when her family was visiting she was requesting i had to move my car for her family to block my car and it was creating disrutbabces she was always contacting me to do it now.¬†\n\nIt was pretty horrible.¬† When she broke into back yard it was her who installed the lock on back yard and then she lost key. She did not give me key to back yard. She then demanded key from me to back yard which she di not give me and then basically i had not realized she was going to brake into back yard and go there without key when I had my laundry drying. I do not know what she told me but police told me that I can reopen the case on Rosie for breaking the lock and going into back yard without working nd destroying my laundry with dust when i was not there. and all the harassment and hysterics.¬†\n\nI cant imagine like a person with the type of problems as her grandson and if she caused problems for him because she was left to baby sit. I need someone¬† mediate with her and it woudl also help a lot to define with her what i can and what repairs and inspections i am ok to order. The pest control was paid to come here regularly she told them to not come here canceled service when the rep was here. There is lot of harassment I woudl drop any claims if she allowed me to stay and continue to pay rent maybe you can tell her I have valid claims an that ell tp settle matters.\n\nThe most significant is proably Solar because even is doors remain to have wholes is solar energy not NG or Oil that s burned even for solar efficient use it woudl help the doors do not have giant holes. Insects all get in¬†\n\nvarious kind even a gekko once got in.\n\nRosie has violent personality and she one time chase gekko with shovel trying to kill it in my back yard.&quot;,
