Referring to running a nation to managing employees, a police force to an army, etc. The problem we saw with Trump was how much he  transformed the United States with a business mindset, we don&amp;#39;t need that a second time. Especially how wishy washy he is. &lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#39;s not good that he&amp;#39;s not consistent on his views, and that he has to fund an entire campaign on his own. He acts like he&amp;#39;s one of the people, but at the end of the day he is a billionaire who has access to lifestyles that the majority do not have access to. I could 100% see him doing the same stuff Trump does, only difference is that he&amp;#39;d probably be less upfront about it.&quot;,

I get that comic relief needs to be in a film to break up the dynamics but it is a star wars film. If you want comedy it should be sourced from another movie. I don&amp;#39;t like mindset this at all.. even though it&amp;#39;s rian&amp;#39;s, the prank call scene at the beginning of the last jedi is an example. If you are to liken the saga as a religion to some people then make it monumental and get the Creator! Finn shouldve died in that last movie as a hero and Carrie (Rip) shouldn&amp;#39;t be in this new one. There are way too many loose ends (ie mistakes) to tie up that it should take up a lot of this time in upcoming movie to solve.&quot;,

                        &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;Thank God!! People have blown this vape thing wayyy out of proportion!! 🙄  Out of 33 deaths, 29 have been 100% proven to be from THC vaping liquids bought OFF THE STREETS. These all have been confirmed by the CDC to have contained Vitamin E acetate in them, an oily chemical every LEGAL/ LEGITIMATE manufacturer has since blacklisted from their lists of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO ONE HAS EVER DIED FROM VAPING A JUUL RESPONSIBLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, EVERY SINGLE MINUTE ONE PERSON DIES FROM INHALING CIGARETTE SMOKE, which every single adult over the age of 21 can legally purchase literally everywhere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad was a daily cigarette smoker since the age of just 14 and now, at the age of 54, I finally got him to stop smoking and its literally 100% due to the now DISCONTINUED mint JUUL Pod. Think about it, that&amp;#39;s LITERALLY 40 STRAIGHT YEARS of inhaling carcinogens from OVER 7000 CHEMICALS EVERY SINGLE DAY! 😳&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now, to be fair, he has told me that he has no plans of going back to smoking cigarettes anytime soon but he&amp;#39;s yet to run out of the mint JUUL Pods and he hasn&amp;#39;t even tried to quit vaping that yet. I&amp;#39;m EXTREMELY worried about him relapsing after he runs out of the mint flavor as there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY he&amp;#39;ll vape menthol or tobacco flavored pods! He definitely hates them and the only reason I couldn&amp;#39;t get him to quit smoking for years was because of the fact that I would always purchase him the tobacco flavored liquid thinking he would liken it to the experience of smoking a cigarette but he absolutely hated the flavor, which I dont blame him to be honest. Not only does it taste nothing like a real cigarette, but it also tastes like complete and utter shit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAKE UP PEOPLE. THIS IS REAL FAKE NEWS.&quot;,
