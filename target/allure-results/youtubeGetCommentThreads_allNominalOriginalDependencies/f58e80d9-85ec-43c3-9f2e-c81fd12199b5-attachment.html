You responded my comment, but you surely haven&amp;#39;t answered it, either the one after that.&lt;br /&gt;So far one thing is clear.

If the Holodomor is a fact, but it is protected by law in at least three countries, then that alone makes a mockery of any idea that the purpose of denial laws is to cover up lies. So congratulations: you have just destroyed your own argument with your own reasoning and logic.&quot;,

                            &quot;textDisplay&quot;: &quot;The original list for Flight 11 included Atta, Adnan Bukhari, Ameer Bukhari, Abdul al-Omari, and Amer Kamfar. On Sept. 14, 2001, federal sources told CNN that Adnan and Ameer Bukhari had been on one of the planes that originated in Boston. Later, this was changed, and they became the pilots of the two planes that were reported to have hit the World Trade Center. Finally this was narrowed down to Flight 11.[7]\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;We were also told that Adnan and Ameer had driven a rented car from Boston to Portland, Maine on Sept. 10, 2001. But that story had to be changed when CNN later reported that Adnan Bukhari was quite alive and still living in Florida, where he had been questioned by the FBI. And Ameer Bukhari had been killed in a small plane crash in Vero Beach, Florida on Sept. 11, 2000.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;So these two names were dropped from the official “hijackers” list and replaced by two more: brothers Wail M. al-Shehri and Waleed M. al-Shehri. Both also turned up alive after 9/11. Waleed protested his innocence from Casablanca, Morocco. The BBC reported that Waleed al-Sheri had attended a flight training school in Daytona, Florida but had left the U.S. in 2000 for Saudi Arabia where he became a pilot with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Thierry Meyssan in his book 9/11: The Big Lie (p. 54) reported that al-Shehri had been interviewed by the Arab-language London-based newspaper Al-Qods al-Arabi after 9/11. Also, according to the Associated Press, he contacted the U.S. embassy in Morocco and explained that he lived in Casablanca and worked as a pilot.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;On Sept. 12, 2001, eight FBI agents arrived at the door of Amer Kamfar’s neighbor in Vero Beach asking if the neighbor knew him. Later Kamfar’s name was removed from the list and replaced by Satam M.A. Al-Suqami (the alleged owner of the famous passport that we’re told floated to the ground near the towers after the first plane impact). But if Kamfar was on the original manifest, where did Al-Suqami’s name come from? And if Kamfar wasn’t on the original list, where did they get his name from?\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;And another name from the Flight 11 list was reported by the Boston Globe to be Abdulrahman al-Omari (who we were told sat next to Mohamed Atta on the plane). But on the list of hijackers released Sept. 14, 2001 by the Justice Department, the name was Abdulaziz al-Omari (sometimes written Abdul Aziz). Meanwhile, the Washington Post listed the name as Abdulrahman that same day. But Abdulaziz was living in Saudi Arabia, according to the Saudi embassy in Washington. The Independent reported on Sept. 17 that he had walked into the U.S. consulate in Jeddah to demand an explanation for why he was being accused of being a suicide hijacker.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;Kolar’s research turned up some fascinating connections between the suspects whose names were on the initial list and then removed. In addition to all being Saudi Arabian pilots living in Vero Beach, Abdulrahman al-Omari and his family lived at the same address as Amer Kamfar. Next door lived Abdulaziz al-Omari. Ameer Bukhari was listed as having the same address as Adnan.[8]\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;It seems that every time there was a problem with an element of the official story, the story changed. This happened with the inexplicable trip by Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari to Portland, Maine mentioned above. Originally, the story was that it was the two Bukharis who had rented the car (a blue Nissan Altima) and driven to Portland. But when one turned out to be dead the year before and the other still alive, the story changed. Now it was Atta who had rented the car and driven with al-Omari to Portland. But it also came out that a white Mitsubishi rented by Atta was found at Logan Airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Adnan Zakaria Bukhari\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;A Saudi flight engineer, was initially reported by CNN to be one of the hijackers aboard American Airlines Flight 11 as part of the September 11, 2001, attacks – HIS NAME WAS EVEN SAID TO HAVE BEEN ON THE FLIGHT MANIFEST.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;Bukhari gave lessons to Saudi Arabian Airlines pilots at the FlightSafety Academy in Vero Beach, where several of the hijackers had trained. As of 2001, he held flight engineer, turbojet, mechanic, airframe, powerplant, instrument panel, and single-engine landing certificates, as well as a First Class Medical Certificate issued in May 2000.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;Between &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM4FbJ1hCUY&amp;amp;t=5m00s\&quot;&gt;5:00&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM4FbJ1hCUY&amp;amp;t=5m30s\&quot;&gt;5:30&lt;/a&gt; on the morning of September 12, FBI agents, backed by a SWAT team, stormed Bukhari&amp;#39;s leased house at 4036 57th Terrace and arrested him, saying that identity cards of him and an Ameer Bukhari, mistakenly thought to be a brother, were found in a rental car the hijackers had left in Portland, Maine. While searching his house, they announced that they had found a copy of Ameer Bukhari&amp;#39;s pilot license, and a &amp;quot;hazardous materials manual&amp;quot;.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;After passing a polygraph, he was released and later cleared of any wrongdoing.&amp;quot;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://911research.fandom.com/wiki/Adnan_Bukhari\&quot;&gt;https://911research.fandom.com/wiki/Adnan_Bukhari\r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Between &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM4FbJ1hCUY&amp;amp;t=5m00s\&quot;&gt;5:00&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM4FbJ1hCUY&amp;amp;t=5m30s\&quot;&gt;5:30&lt;/a&gt; on the morning of September 12, FBI agents backed by a SWAT team stormed Bukhari&amp;#39;s leased house at 4036 57th Terrace and arrested him - citing that identity cards of him and an Ameer Bukhari (mistakenly thought to be a brother) were found in a rental car the hijackers had left in Portland, Maine; though it later turned out that Ameer had died a year earlier, and had no relation to Adnan.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;Agents evacuated nearby houses, citing concerns that Adnan Bukhari&amp;#39;s house was rigged with explosives, and took him to Miami for questioning. While searching his house, they announced that they had found a copy of Ameer Bukhari&amp;#39;s pilot license, and a &amp;quot;hazardous materials manual&amp;quot;[1]. After passing a polygraph, he was released and later cleared of any wrongdoing.&amp;quot;\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;However, the FBI did say it no longer was looking for Amer Taiyb Kamfar, who lived at the same Vero Beach address as Abdul Rahman Alomari, identified as Abdulaziz Alomari on the list of suspected hijackers. The alert for Kamfar, put out to all law enforcement agencies on Wednesday, had described him as armed and extremely dangerous. FBI spokeswoman Judy Orihuela said she couldn&amp;#39;t comment on why the bulletin was rescinded. \r&lt;br /&gt;The FBI also released Vero Beach resident Adnan Bukhari, who lived next door to Alomari. Agents had spent 12 hours searching Bukhari&amp;#39;s house at 4036 57th Terrace after a dawn raid Wednesday. \r&lt;br /&gt;At 10:30 p.m. Thursday, FBI agents returned to the house, towed Bukhari&amp;#39;s Plymouth Voyager and took several boxes from the house, according to a neighbor who asked not to be identified. The neighbor said Bukhari did not return to his house. Bukhari did not attend a student meeting at FlightSafety Academy, said Mamduh Felmban, Bukhari&amp;#39;s training partner. \r&lt;br /&gt;Bukhari&amp;#39;s attorney told CNN Wednesday that Bukhari is not connected with the terrorist attacks, that he is helping authorities, and that any documents found with his name meant his identity was stolen. He said Bukhari had passed an FBI-administered lie detector test. He also said Ameer Bukhari, the pilot killed in a mid-air crash in Vero Beach last Sept. 11, was not his brother, as had been reported.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/lofiversion/index.php?t13370.html\&quot;&gt;http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/lofiversion/index.php?t13370.html\r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 19, an FAA employee named James P. Hopkins was fired for independently going through FAA records and reporting to the FBI that Bukhari had trained at the FAA&amp;#39;s academy in Oklahoma City twice, in 1991 and 1998. The Office of Special Counsel reviewed the case and awarded Hopkins his employment back, citing unfair termination.[2]\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;Before CNN learned the identities of the two brothers, Portland Police Chief Mike Chitwood said, &amp;quot;I can tell you those two individuals did get on a plane and fly to Boston early yesterday morning ...

I do not know ANY paratrooper who would NOT shoot an enemy dragging way a fellow paratrooper--in fact--I would have shot anyone who would have LET the enemy drag away a comrade. The rest of his MH citation is just basic soldiering under fire--more than 250 paratroopers at Dak-To preformed better than Giunta under fire and died in the process. This MH is purely political given to an Italian-American stationed in Italy. It is very sad we have lowered the standards for our highest military valor award to meet political objectives.&quot;,

I find it hard to believe that the first black president and the most highly educated first lady in history, along with two civil rights activists have set racism back by 60 years.

Plus, it is a well documented fact, supported by the White House Historical Association and the New York Times (not to mention countless historians) that the White House was indeed built by slaves. Also, I feel as though once Donald&amp;#39;s reign begins and the general public are free to get automatic weapons and mass shootings go up, and healthcare is repealed for those most in need and the rest of the world is either laughing at America or choosing to duck and cover, even the most closed-minded, ignorant of the Obama haters will think back on this time of relative peace and prosperity with nostalgia. Finally, again with the names? I admit these were slightly less offensive, but I still don&amp;#39;t see the need.&quot;,
