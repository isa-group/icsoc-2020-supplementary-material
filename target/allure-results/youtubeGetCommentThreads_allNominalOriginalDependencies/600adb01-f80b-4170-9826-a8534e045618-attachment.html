He is supposedly the “leader” of the group, and he was the first member who joined in 2010. He is also a rapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second row :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right Window: Jungkook&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jungkook is probably the quietest one in the group, recently he has improved a lot in English, by the help of RM of course. He is the youngest member, and he is a vocalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle : Hoseok/J-HOPE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The human embodiment of a sunshine, and happiness. A lot of people cherish him, and adore him by his positive energy and no one can resist him. He is a rapper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Window on the left : Jimin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimin is known for his “attractive” appearances,  on MV’s, Tours, Performances, etc. However he’s known to be really adorable online. Even if you aren’t Army, you’ve definitely seen people talk about him before. And he is also a vocalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third row: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left window: V/Tae/Taehyung&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V is known to be the most chill, and relaxed member out of everyone. However, when he’s happy and or excited, he can seem like a whole different person. He’s also known for collecting Gucci clothing. And he’s a vocalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The middle : Suga&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suga is that one member who’s unbothered by everything. He’s usually cold, and doesn’t talk much, but he can also be a really nice guy, and deeply cares about the other members. He’s a rapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last but definitely not least:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left window: Seokjin/Jin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jin is actually the oldest in the group, in Korea the oldest person in a certain group should be the most respected, responsible, and has more power than the rest. However, Jin doesn’t really care about that. Jin can make anyone laugh with his wtf-ery, and he also has a lot of nicknames he goes by, and a lot of iconic lines. A really popular one is him referring to himself as; “Worldwide handsome”. Him, and J-HOPE are also known to be the most cowards of the band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize if some of these were inaccurate and or short, I wanted to make really quick descriptions of them.&quot;,

You know very well my central point was that protectionism has deleterious effects on national economies, and that the GD is an important example of such. Even the most liberal, partisan economists out there will concede that the Smoot-Hawley tariffs had a negative effect on the national economy, provoked a protectionist backlash among US trading partners, which then prolonged the depression on a global scale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of your remarks are a testament to your complete lack of understanding of international trade and the long-term impacts of past trade deals. They are oft-repeated lines of attack that get debunked, repeatedly, only to pop up again, like a game of whack-a-mole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the facts about job loss that resulted from the North American trade agreement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Since NAFTA’s enactment, fewer than 5 percent of US workers who have lost jobs from sizable layoffs (such as when large plants close down) can be attributed to rising imports from Mexico.[2] By our calculations for the roughly 200,000 out of 4 million people who lose their jobs annually under these circumstances, the job losses can be attributed to rising imports from Mexico, and almost the same number of new jobs has been created annually by rising US exports to Mexico. The net annual job losses are perhaps in the low tens of thousands, about 15,000. For every net job lost in this definition, the gains to the US economy were about $450,000, owing to enhanced productivity of the workforce, a broader range of goods and services, and lower prices at the checkout counter for households.[3]&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we&amp;#39;re talking about a measly portion of the total number of jobs lost annually, which were offset by the gains from rising exports. You lose more jobs in your state on account of inter-state commerce than you do because of trade with Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just don&amp;#39;t understand how international trade functions.&quot;,
