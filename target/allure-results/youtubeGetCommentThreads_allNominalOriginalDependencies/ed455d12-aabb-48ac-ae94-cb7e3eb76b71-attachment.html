Early on, we saw a bulge in the southwest corner between floors 10 and 13, and we had put a transit on that and we were pretty sure she was going to collapse. You actually could see there was a visible bulge, it ran up about three floors. It came down about 5 o’clock in the afternoon, but by about 2 o’clock in the afternoon we realized this thing was going to collapse.&amp;quot; - Deputy Chief Peter Hayden\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;There was a huge gaping hole and it was scattered throughout there. It was a huge hole. I would say it was probably about a third of it, right in the middle of it.....On the north and east side of 7 it didn’t look like there was any damage at all, but then you looked on the south side of 7 there had to be a hole 20 stories tall in the building, with fire on several floors. Debris was falling down on the building and it didn’t look good.\r&lt;br /&gt;That was the first time really my stomach tightened up because the building didn’t look good......Then this other officer I’m standing next to said, that building doesn’t look straight. So I’m standing there. I’m looking at the building. It didn’t look right, but, well, we’ll go in, we’ll see. So we gathered up rollups and most of us had masks at that time. We headed toward 7. And just around we were about a hundred yards away and Butch Brandies came running up. He said forget it, nobody’s going into 7, there’s creaking, there are noises coming out of there, so we just stopped.&amp;quot; - Captain Chris Boyle NYFD\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;they were worried about 7 World Trade Center, which is right behind it, coming down. We were up on the upper floors of the Verizon building looking at it. You could just see the whole bottom corner of the building was gone. We could look right out over to where the Trade Centers were because we were that high up. Looking over the smaller buildings. I just remember it was tremendous, tremendous fires going on. Finally they pulled us out.&amp;quot; - Richard Banaciski NYFD Firefigher\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The biggest decision we had to make on the first day was to clear the area and create a collapse zone around the severely damaged WTC 7 a 47-story building heavily involved in fire. A number of fire officers and companies assessed the damage to the building. The appraisals indicated that the building&amp;#39;s integrity was in serious doubt.

You have some serious issue kid. What you believe is so easily refuted, this really isn&amp;#39;t the workings of a sound mind. Are you currently on medication? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next you claim these jets couldn&amp;#39;t reach those speeds at low altitude although Boeing have no issue with it so telling me you called them makes you, once again  an outright liar!!! Given the sheer lunacy of what you believe, and how readily you blatantly lie, I think I&amp;#39;ll stick with what Boeing &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; say and I assure you, they have no issue with the speeds and manoeuvres their aircrafts achieved that day. In fact, test pilots take them beyond these speeds all the time without issue. Those planes can EASILY exceed those speeds during a dive. Is it safe to do so? Hell no. Is there a danger of suffering some structural damage? Indeed, if the speed is sustained but certainly not instantly. So in the case of what we observed happen on that day, those guys dived into their targets to achieve those speeds, but only sustained them momentarily before crashing. Safety and consideration for the structural integrity of the plane&amp;#39;s airframe really wasn&amp;#39;t high on their priority list.&lt;br /&gt;Your one and only news clip of the plane is in fact several videos both professional and amateur taken from several different angles. I&amp;#39;ve already told you wreckage was found first responders, people were hit by plane wreckage ejected from the towers, other pilots witnessed them prior to crashing as did tens of thousands of people who saw them flying overhead; the radar evidence, the physical remains and personal belongings of those on board, the list of evidence is overwhelming and categorically PROVES you wrong many times over. Ignoring the facts won&amp;#39;t make them go away sorry Mongo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Same BS NASA feeds you&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you&amp;#39;re a lunar landing denier too huh?

After I&#39;ve finished responding to this comment, I&#39;m going to quote the fire fighters who were there detailing the reality of which you&#39;re bizarrely so desperate to dismiss.\n\n\&quot;Boeing jet Airliners run on compressed air\&quot;\n\nYou&#39;re fuckong mental. You have some serious issue kid. What you believe is so easily refuted, this really isn&#39;t the workings of a sound mind. Are you currently on medication? \n\nNext you claim these jets couldn&#39;t reach those speeds at low altitude although Boeing have no issue with it so telling me you called them makes you, once again  an outright liar!!! Given the sheer lunacy of what you believe, and how readily you blatantly lie, I think I&#39;ll stick with what Boeing _actually_ say and I assure you, they have no issue with the speeds and manoeuvres their aircrafts achieved that day. In fact, test pilots take them beyond these speeds all the time without issue. Those planes can EASILY exceed those speeds during a dive. Is it safe to do so? Hell no. Is there a danger of suffering some structural damage? Indeed, if the speed is sustained but certainly not instantly. So in the case of what we observed happen on that day, those guys dived into their targets to achieve those speeds, but only sustained them momentarily before crashing. Safety and consideration for the structural integrity of the plane&#39;s airframe really wasn&#39;t high on their priority list.\nYour one and only news clip of the plane is in fact several videos both professional and amateur taken from several different angles. I&#39;ve already told you wreckage was found first responders, people were hit by plane wreckage ejected from the towers, other pilots witnessed them prior to crashing as did tens of thousands of people who saw them flying overhead; the radar evidence, the physical remains and personal belongings of those on board, the list of evidence is overwhelming and categorically PROVES you wrong many times over. Ignoring the facts won&#39;t make them go away sorry Mongo.\n\n\&quot;Same BS NASA feeds you\&quot; \n\nSo you&#39;re a lunar landing denier too huh? Didn&#39;t see that one coming 🤪👈🏽 lol. Am I right in saying you&#39;re a flat earther? 🤔&quot;,

I have to say that I have gone no contact with my mother. It always sent a chill down my spine just hugging her much less serving as you did your mother... I don’t know how you did it. You are a true angel! I have my husband, who is the love of my life, and our two children, both grown and nearly grown now but we are so close. That is all the family I need. Thanks again for the kind comment! Happy holidays! ❤️&quot;,

When she was alive I honored what I think my deceased father and what God would want me to do. Plus I would have felt guilty if I treated my mom any different.&lt;br /&gt;As always even when I was a little girl I did everything for my mom. In her older age I came 20 miles everyday 1 way  after I took my daughter to school; cleaned her house rubbed my mom&amp;#39;s legs with lotion (everyday) scraped the bottom of her feet clipped her toenails gave her massages groceries everything and anything I could.... did the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;I even overheard her tell my sister and a few other times telling people she didn&amp;#39;t like me but I was like a slave and she can make me do anything in the world. Yes I was probably pathetic. If she had died and I did not do what I did being the person I am I think I would have had regrets and guilts.&lt;br /&gt;So, finishing up on my story, the day my mother died a big weight was lifted off my shoulder you won&amp;#39;t believe! To this day I am so relieved and so happy it&amp;#39;s just so wonderful! I&amp;#39;m serious as a doorstop I&amp;#39;m living my life and I&amp;#39;m so so so so happy.&lt;br /&gt;Just know McIntosh that Your day will come.... you will know exactly what I&amp;#39;m talking about! In the meantime just be you and be happy with what you do is what&amp;#39;s important.&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#39;s okay to be hurt but to make yourself sad is not okay. Just go on and be happy with yourself. All my best to you💖&quot;,
